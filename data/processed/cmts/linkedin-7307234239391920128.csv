-   Blending online + offline experiences
-   Leveraging Al & data-driven retail.
-   Creating community-driven shopping

On the other hand, for example,  I see that  the Fashion's biggest names of past,  are also struggling 
Hence I see them at scale also, making unexpected moves- stores shutting, digital shifting, and retail reinventing itself.

Ajay Parasrampuria,https://www.linkedin.com/in/ajayparasrampuria,Reading systems. Designing what holds.,"I like the focus on time as the real competition. It’s a reminder that consumer trust compounds slowly, not in viral spikes.

I wish more founders respected the operating system of India - a value-conscious, multi-generational consumer mindset that rewards brands offering consistency over gimmicks.

I wonder how many brands fail because they chase tech startup growth curves, ignoring that FMCG and consumer brands are built through distribution depth, repeatable quality, and ritual adoption.

Insight: 
In India, brands aren’t built, they’re earned - over decades, not quarters.
