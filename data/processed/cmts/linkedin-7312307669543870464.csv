Deepak Kumar,https://www.linkedin.com/in/deepakbkumar,I know I’ll Win,"Hi Rishabh Mariwala

EdTech didn’t fail—it was just built on the wrong foundation. High CAC, deep discounts, and one-time course sales made it unsustainable.

I’m Deepak Kumar, Co-founder of Edu Tantr, and we’ve solved this. Eduk8 – India’s first OTT for Skills-Based Learning – is already driving revenue from colleges.

🚀 Colleges are already paying – No deep discounts, no unsustainable acquisition costs.
💰 A ₹10,000 Cr+ market opportunity – And we have the right playbook to scale.
🔁 Recurring Revenue Model – Built for long-term, profitable growth.

But this is just half the story. Eduk8 isn’t just an OTT—it’s the foundation of something much bigger. There’s an entire layer beyond this that makes our model truly scalable and defensible.

I’d love to share how we’re building beyond OTT—can we schedule a quick 10-minute call this week? Let me know a time that works for you.

Best regards,
Deepak Kumar

2. Their CAC & CPC gets higher 
3. Never establish brand positioning

I know so many brands that would shut down if ads were paused for more than a month. In fact, 10% of our revenue comes from retention campaigns, beyond regular orders.

Quality, customer experience, and brand values are key. A strong social media presence may get your foot in the door, but it’s the experience that keeps customers coming back. Many brands overthink discounts for existing customers while focusing purely on new customer acquisition. However, the LTV of existing customers is far better if basics are sorted, and upto 30% discounts to keep them happy are a small dip in margins (but still profitable) when you're not blindly spending on CAC.

Building a customer base is crucial, but at a certain point, once you have a decent number, focus on quality, customer experience and horizontal expansion—adding more SKUs to cater to the needs and lifestyle of your existing customers—becomes key to survival in the long run.

Product-Market Fit Matters More Than You Think  

Your story, brand packaging, marketing, and branding strategy can drive your first sale—but after that, only the product truly matters.  

While discussing with many founders through PreBuy—India’s first tech and data-driven Direct-to-Retail company, helping D2C brands launch, scale, and sustain their B2B growth, I noticed a common challenge:  

Many brands fail to fully validate their products. They rely on limited sampling within their own circle, without real market data or insights. This leads to a critical gap in product consistency and repeat sales.  

Brands often place their products across D2C, B2B, marketplaces, and quick commerce, thinking turnover is growing. However, the real test comes after 3-12 months when repeat purchase data reveals true demand. Many don’t track this properly, mistaking new customers and new retail shelves as continuous growth.  

Without repeat purchases, the numbers start catching up and after a year, brands struggle to sustain growth  

This is exactly the problem we solve at PreBuy—a data and tech-enabled Direct-to-Retail company that ensures brands make informed decisions based on real market insights.
