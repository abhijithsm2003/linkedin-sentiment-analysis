Isha Roy,https://www.linkedin.com/in/isharoy,"Strategy, GTM & Ops | Ex Founder's Office @ OTPLESS | Prev: Zomato, Deloitte USI, EY","This hit hard.
Because the truth is - growth is addictive.

You start confusing momentum with strength.
Investor interest, rising demand, positive CACs - it’s validating, yes. But it can also blind you.

Because growth hides cracks.
You might be acquiring customers, but are they coming back?
You might be shipping more, but are your ops quietly bleeding margin?
You might be expanding, but are your systems - your team, tech, supply chain - ready for what you’re asking of them?

Everyone wants to scale. Few are ready to sustain that scale.
That’s why this idea matters.

Because pausing isn't weakness - it’s control.
It’s asking the hard questions before your growth breaks you.

The most resilient brands aren’t obsessed with velocity. They’re obsessed with alignment.

Because speed without stability = noise.
And discipline? That’s what turns growth into legacy.",2025-05-14T06:03:02.535Z,"urn:li:comment:(activity:7328290816743895041,7328298780733206528)",
