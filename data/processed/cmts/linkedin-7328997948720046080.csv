This series is sharp because it goes beyond the glitter. Endorsements, when done right, are not shortcuts to fame but extensions of trust. In my experience, what moves the needle isn’t fame, it’s fit. A hyper-relevant micro-influencer has outperformed a Bollywood name for us more than once, because they were loved inside the community, not just on screen.

Would love to see a follow-up on brand-to-endorser power dynamics, especially when equity is on the table. That’s where the real negotiations begin.",2025-05-16T05:11:12.805Z,"urn:li:comment:(ugcPost:7328997948720046080,7329010513311399938)",
