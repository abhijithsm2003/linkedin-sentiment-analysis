Many new generation companies would like to be a part of Marathon or would like to ring the bell quickly within a couple of years. This expectation is like a now-a-days quick commerce delivery of Blinkit or Zepto. But, as rightly mentioned term ""Convenience"" would have already done the damage where Equity share or Ownership % is already swallowed by ""Convenience"" at a ""Convenient Time"" by the temporary fixes on regular intervals. Just by paying high efficiency can't be purchased. Trust, Ownership and understanding every minute operational Know-How will align every Individual towards the Core Values.
