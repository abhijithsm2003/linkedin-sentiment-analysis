Every brand talks about “delighting the customer” 
 but delight isn’t confetti.

It’s how you show up when it’s inconvenient.

Trust is built in the trenches:
- When the order's wrong.
- When the app crashes.
- When the delivery fails.

That moment of frustration is also a moment of decision
will you dodge, deflect, or show up with integrity?

Because in a world of cashback and coupons, basic respect feels revolutionary.
