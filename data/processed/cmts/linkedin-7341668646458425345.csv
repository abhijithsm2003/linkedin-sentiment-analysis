While hiring the right candidates is crucial, it’s equally important that we have the right management and leadership in place to nurture, guide, and retain that talent. The best hires can only thrive under clear direction, a strong culture, and empowered leadership.

From an employer and top management perspective, great teams are built when:

Leadership sets the tone – through clarity, accountability, and inspiration
Hiring aligns with purpose – not just skills, but values and long-term fit
Managers are mentors – creating environments where people can grow and perform
Culture is intentional – because talent without alignment leads to friction

The real differentiator isn’t just who we hire, but how we lead them.

Thanks for bringing this conversation forward!

First set of employees would believe in the brands vision blindly and trust founders for their long term substantial growth.

But, as an organisation or owning decision making at their end one should always think about justice being done for the contributions made with lesser support on the infrastructure front without any cushioning of statutory compliances in the initial days or couple of years. Later when new hires join, for them red carpet is laid out with the proper infra but their demands would be very high and non negotiable. At the end what it matters for the business? On Ground Contribution, Growth and Building a Brand. Till the time every individual at work understands this and drives the things on his own right Culture wouldn't come into existence.
