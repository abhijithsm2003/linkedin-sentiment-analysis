Distribution is not an afterthought , it’s a strategic imperative . 
Of the original 4 P’s, Place often gets the least attention , ironically, it’s the one that determines whether your product even stands a chance to be discovered. In today’s fragmented landscape, with D2C, marketplaces, offline, omnichannel, and partner-led routes , how and where you reach your customer needs as much clarity as what you offer them.
A strong GTM strategy is not a scale lever. It’s a survival lever.
And I fully endorse your points , Distribution planning should start not after the product is ready, but before it is even packaged. It should influence your pricing, margins, channel mix, visibility strategy, and even your product design choices.

Our belief: distribution is not a channel—it’s your strategy.

That’s why we started with local vendors already trusted by the customer, instead of trying to displace them.
We didn’t just design packaging—we built the entire delivery loop: fresh meat, fish, groceries & more, delivered via partners the customer already buys from.

Distribution is discovery. Without access, even the best product dies silent.

Appreciate this perspective 👏

As a food and consumer VC, I’ve seen far too many pitches where distribution is an afterthought—shoehorned in after the product roadmap and packaging design. But in today’s hyper-competitive landscape, even a 10/10 product will fail if it shows up on a 2/10 channel.
I believe Before the first unit rolls off the line, founders must ask:
Where is my customer already spending attention, time, and money?
Retail shelf? Insta reel? WhatsApp group? Modern trade? Kirana stack?
Great distribution isn't built. It's understood.
It’s not about spraying wide—it’s about hitting exact.
Visibility ≠ velocity.
Real scale comes when access meets intent.",2025-06-30T05:03:17.397Z,"urn:li:comment:(activity:7345314241937035264,7345315973257703426)",
