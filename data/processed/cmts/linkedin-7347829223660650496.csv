Krishna Mohan Nyayapati,https://www.linkedin.com/in/nkm2612,"Management Consultant | Driving Growth & Professional Transformation for Promoter-Led FMCG & Consumer Companies | Expert in Strategy, Execution & People Leadership | Creating Scalable, Sustainable & Profitable Business","Rishabh Mariwala insightful as ever!! 

While you can't hire someone to ""sell something the market does not want,"" you can hire someone who can help you figure out what the market does want and then build it.   

Also the hire might tell you the fact which founders seldom want to listen and thats  POOR MARKET FIT!!

The nuance is that senior talent isn't just a megaphone; they can be the compass and the mapmaker, especially when the initial direction is unclear or incorrect.
Ultimately, it comes down to how you use senior talent. If you hire them merely to ""amplify your direction"" when that direction is flawed, then yes, it's a wasted effort. 
But if you hire them to collaboratively find the right direction and then lead the charge, they can be an invaluable asset in solving a broken product's fundamental issues.

For example, Recruitment market these days is cluttered with multiple solutions. Still hiring is noisy, transactional and trustless. Companies are overwhelmed with irrelevant, mass applications
Even great roles get buried under hundreds of random CVs most unvetted, many unfit. Hiring teams spend hours screening, interviewing, and still make bad or culture-misaligned hires. Meanwhile, top professionals want to refer people from their network, but they have majorly access to refer them in their current company. But what if they don't have a role available for their trusted referral in their current company? They check offline -Where do I refer them where it actually helps? That's what Lookin.club is trying to solve by reincarnating the real essence of hiring through trusted referrals, the way it used to happen before the advent of job portals. Its an invite-only platform where top industry professionals not only refer CVs, they actually put their reputation on the line and thinks about overall fit and not just a skill-match",2025-07-10T02:21:02.293Z,"urn:li:comment:(activity:7347829223660650496,7348899019932274688)",
