Early-stage startups often need to chase topline initially to prove a market exists, attract funding, and build momentum. The mistake comes when they never pivot from that strategy. The real art is knowing when to shift from the 'growth at all costs' mindset to the 'sustainable engine' model.

 In the #Marwari90Code, we say:
 ""Don’t chase the numbers. Chase the nerve that triggers them.""
Richard Branson once said —
 “Business opportunities are like buses, there’s always another one coming. But only insight tells you which one to board.”
A 3rd-gen textile trader in Bikaner once told me:
 “My margins grew only after I started asking my regulars not what they wanted to buy, but why they bought from me.”
He stopped selling sarees. He started curating memories.
That’s when word-of-mouth became windfall.
Insight isn’t a spreadsheet metric. It’s an emotional pattern.
