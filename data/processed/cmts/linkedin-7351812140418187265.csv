I left non veg completely 13 years back. I don't know why I ate so many years but last 13 years not once I had the desire also. All this started post a forward email. 

It makes a difference to this one to each one--  leave living beings to live their normal life. Don't make a burial ground in your stomach 

Don't earn curses 


But I say this if this topic is raised 
It's sad i am not campaigning against this. 
Thanks for raising this

This is my 2 cents campaign & hopefully it will become bigger and a revolution
