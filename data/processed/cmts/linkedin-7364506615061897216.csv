You've hit on the very essence of what separates a flash in the pan from a lasting legacy. For 25 years, I've seen countless companies chase awareness, only to stumble because they forgot that true brand strength isn't built on a megaphone—it's built on trust and a product that consistently delivers. I've  always believed that the  core mission of ( all/any) organisation is to create products ( or services) so indispensable, so reliable, that they turn customers into advocates.

In today's market if you aren't seen being a new brand. At very first go specially in consumable category consumer tries a product out after repeated visibility. They slowly trust over time and then they try out hoping it would be good. If they are not even seen, the first purchase will be extremely difficult, and repeat won't even come into picture. Ofcourse, Consistent product quality is a mandatory offering. 

So new brands should use advertising to some extent in lean and optimised way to build awareness which will lead to first round of purchase and product quality will then help them to retain and get repeat orders. 

Over the time if marketing spend is not going down and repeat isn't going up, then i believe that's an issue of PMF which is a bad indicator.",2025-08-22T12:59:44.263Z,"urn:li:comment:(activity:7364506615061897216,7364642432140877824)",
