We’re Karma Clothing ,  a founder-led Delhi label building premium, pure-cotton kurtis with one practical obsession: they must work in real life.
We focus on the small, often-ignored details that change everyday behaviour: breathable fabric, honest fits, and real pockets placed where you’ll actually use them. Add small-batch runs (no overproduction), transparent workmanship, and fair pricing — and you get pieces people reach for again and again.

Why it matters:
• Comfort = repeat wear — pure cotton that breathes in Indian weather.
• Pockets that perform — tiny design choice, huge daily payoff (phone, keys, chai).
• Small-batch & local — better quality control, less waste, more exclusivity.
• Fair pricing — premium feel without premium shock.

People don’t buy another kurti from us because it’s trendy — they buy it because it becomes their go-to. If that sounds like the kind of product you believe in, follow Karma Clothing  or DM us for a sample, pop-up collab, or wholesale conversation.

Multiple times.
Because I knew the cost.

With capital comes pressure: scale faster, hire quicker, hit vanity metrics to justify the valuation. But I wasn’t building a startup. I was building something cultural. Timeless. With depth.

I’ve seen too many great ideas get rushed, diluted, or destroyed because the money arrived before the soul was ready.

Sometimes the bravest thing you can do as a founder is say:
“Not yet.”
