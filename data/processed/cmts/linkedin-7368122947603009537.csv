The non-alcoholic “spirits” category wasn’t created out of thin air — it emerged from a very real consumer need: wanting the rituals, flavors, and social belonging of premium spirits, without the alcohol.

What we’ve seen is less about “creating” a category, and more about reframing an existing behaviour — the aperitif, the cocktail, the celebratory pour — through a different lens. By doing so, we’re not just addressing convenience or distribution, but actually nudging cultural habits around moderation, wellness, and inclusivity.

That, to me, is the essence of category creation: not the headlines, but the quiet, consistent shift in how people choose to drink (or not drink).",2025-09-01T05:28:39.050Z,"urn:li:comment:(activity:7368122947603009537,7368152791070015488)",
