the markets at India,
as you perceived above,
is very complex.
It is paradoxical in many ways,,
each contradiction will lay
immense learning opportunities so to say,
and the businesses from abroad,
who arrive scouting for the unsatiated markets,
get much more in return,
they count the dollars,
but never declare the gains,

which surpasses now to put previous one to shame.
