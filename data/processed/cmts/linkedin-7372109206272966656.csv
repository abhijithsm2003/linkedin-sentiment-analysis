Many teams get caught up in fancy metrics and survey scores, but the real signal lies in customer actions.
Looking at it from an investor’s lens makes it even clearer - when a customer buys without discounts, comes back, and advocates for the product, that’s when you know you’ve built real value.

We built UserJot partly because of this exact problem. Users tell you everything is fine in surveys, but when you give them a feedback board where they can vote, the real issues become obvious. The stuff with 50+ upvotes is what's actually driving people away.

The voting itself is the behavior that matters. They're taking time out of their day to find your board, submit feedback, and vote on others' ideas. That's 10x more signal than any satisfaction score.

Also noticed users who submit feedback have way higher retention. Not because we build everything they ask for, but because they're invested enough to engage.
