Rishabh, this post is a stark reminder that easy money doesn’t just fund growth; it often funds complacency. When capital arrives too early, it blinds founders to the discipline that scarcity teaches. And when the tide turns, the habits built in comfort become the very reasons companies collapse.
The paradox is brutal: abundance tests character more than adversity ever will. In scarcity, every rupee is weighed; in abundance, it’s waved. In scarcity, founders obsess over unit economics; in abundance, they outsource wisdom to vanity metrics.
The founders who endure are the ones who treat every cycle — boom or bust — with the same paranoia, precision, and patience. They understand that capital is not a crutch. It’s an amplifier. It magnifies either your clarity or your confusion.
And that’s the deeper truth hidden in your words: funding doesn’t create discipline — it reveals it. It doesn’t shape the company’s DNA — it exposes whether the DNA was strong enough to begin with.

Cheap capital can mask weak foundations, but only for a while. When the tide goes out, it’s the discipline not the dollars that keeps a brand afloat.

I've seen brands pour crores into performance ads without ever asking... who are we when the offers end? Because the real audit isn't CAC or ROAS... it's character. What do you do when growth isn't viral, but earned? When you can’t outspend the market, only out-care it? The founders I trust are the ones who stay lean not out of scarcity, but out of principle... who still pick their own packaging or write their own pitch notes even post-funding. Because when capital enters, your clarity should deepen, not blur.
