 Precision is rarer discipline.
Rishabh, what you’ve captured so clearly is how family offices play the long game — not by chasing returns, but by engineering conviction.
In a world obsessed with quarterly performance, the ability to think in decades becomes a moat in itself.
 Because while speed creates headlines, staying power creates history.
I’ve always believed great investing isn’t just about finding the next big thing — it’s about understanding the invisible forces shaping demand before others even notice.
When capital moves with clarity instead of urgency, value compounds quietly — not in spikes, but in layers.
