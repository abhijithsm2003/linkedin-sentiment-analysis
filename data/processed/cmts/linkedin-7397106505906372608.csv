S Haider,https://www.linkedin.com/in/shaiderofficial,Founder & CEO Spunky | TEDx Speaker | BW 40Under40 | Young Entrepreneur Building High-Impact Brands,"Brilliantly put. Depth is the real unfair advantage in venture.

Capital can be matched sometimes even multiplied  but context, reputation, and accumulated pattern recognition can’t be copied. When you truly own a niche, you stop being “one of the options” and start becoming the default strategic partner for the best founders.

Founders don’t just look for money; they look for someone who speaks their language, understands their battlefield, and can see around corners with them. That kind of trust is built only through years of immersion, not breadth.

Expertise compounds faster than capital… and in the long run, it compounds far more value too.

Insightful as always, Rishabh Mariwala. 👏",2025-11-24T20:16:35.443Z,"urn:li:comment:(activity:7397106505906372608,7398816829164437504)",

SUNDAR RAMACHANDRAN IYER,https://www.linkedin.com/in/sundar-ramachandran-iyer-57389027,"I Build Businesses, Not Just Brands | CEO @ I Inc. | Strategy, Sourcing & Scale Across E-commerce, Retail, CSD/CPC, GeM & Exports | Making Companies Built to Last","It’s wild how few people in venture actually practise what you’ve called out here, Rishabh. Everyone talks about “focus,” but very few are willing to sit inside a niche long enough to earn the right to have an opinion.

The truth is uncomfortable.
You don’t win by spreading capital across categories.
You win by letting a category shape your instincts.

There’s a moment every great investor reaches: when you stop “tracking” a space and start feeling it. When you can sense an inflection before the deck is even built. When founders talk to you not because you have money, but because you carry context.

That transformation only happens through immersion.
Through the long, unglamorous seasons of paying attention when no one else is looking.

Your line about relevance landing before the list even begins hits hard. That’s the real moat. And it’s the one moat you can’t manufacture overnight.

Makes me wonder:
How many investors are actually prepared to stay in one lane long enough to let expertise become instinct?

Most want velocity.
Only a few want depth.
And depth is where the compounding really happens.

The more time you spend inside a sector — speaking with operators, understanding constraints, seeing patterns compounding — the more clarity you build on what actually moves the needle.

The idea of ""owning a niche"" is key. It moves you from being a capital provider to an essential domain expert and partner. The best founders don't just want money; they want the strategic advantage that comes from an investor who knows the category's map and the future terrain.
