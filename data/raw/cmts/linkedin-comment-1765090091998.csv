The only issue is as founders, most of our energy & focus goes into evaluating vendors, talent and customers. It is natural for most of us to simply not getting stuck at step 1 that is raising. Just get the money in the bank and get back to execution.

If Investors strictly clearly state their thesis & more importantly, follow the stated thesis, that would really help a lot and eliminate a lot of mismatch in expectations.

Sustainable businesses grow through steady cycles where teams learn, rebuild and refine their operating model. Capital that understands this rhythm creates space for better decisions instead of pushing for momentum that the system cannot support.

What I have seen is that patient investors strengthen culture. They allow founders to solve real problems, build processes that last and create the compounding effect that only shows up after years of disciplined work.

It brings focus back to choosing partners who stay aligned through the slow phases. That alignment often becomes the advantage that carries a company through scale.
