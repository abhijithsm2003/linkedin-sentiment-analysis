tapas,sethi,tapas sethi,https://www.linkedin.com/in/tapas-sethi-0b6b75397,Founder at — NScliq | Building India’s most accessible healthcare platform | Simplifying medical access for every Indian 🇮🇳 Dm:- tapassethi005@gmail.com,comment,"Hey sir 👋
Hope you’re doing well!

I’m Tapas, Founder & CEO of NScliq — building India’s first fully integrated healthcare system.

Even today, patients struggle for basic access: • 10 Cr+ people visit private clinics daily, but there’s no unified system
• Reports, tests, and appointments take days
• Rural healthcare still confusing & under-connected
• Emergency & surgery bookings are chaotic with zero transparency

NScliq connects clinics + doctors + diagnostics + pharmacy + ambulances + surgeries into one platform — making healthcare fast, transparent & accessible anywhere.

Why I’m building this:
In 2022 I had a knee injury and had to visit 20+ clinics, waited months for MRI & surgery. That experience showed me how broken the system really is — and became my mission.

Vision – Pan-India rollout with rural-first approach
– Digital medical identity for every citizen
– Revenue: appointments, diagnostics, pharmacy, hospital partnerships & insurance

Ask Looking for the right mentor & early-stage investor to build this at scale.
If you’re open, I’d love 10 minutes to share the roadmap 🙏

Thank you for your time, Tapas | Founder & CEO – NScliq 📧 tapassethi005@gmail.com

People often assume that all Chinese products in the Indian market exist only because of heavy VC funding. Yes, funding helped many Chinese tech companies scale rapidly, but their true strength lies in speed, creativity, and a strong manufacturing ecosystem.

It’s not about copying, but watching, learning, adapting, and matching the speed.

So the real question must be: are we building robust ventures or merely inflating valuation bubbles? Until the first, all enthusiasm about growth remains rhetoric.”
