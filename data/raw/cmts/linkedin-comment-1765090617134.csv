Sourav,Sinha,Sourav Sinha,https://www.linkedin.com/in/sourav,Co-founder at Brainium. Helping companies build strong tech teams and grow faster. 26 years in sales.,comment,"This is so true, and I’ve seen it from the other side. The real threat rarely shows up looking like a threat. It shows up as a small shift in customer behaviour that most teams shrug off. By the time the pattern becomes visible in the boardroom, someone scrappy has already built a version of the future that customers find more intuitive.

I learned this early in my sales career in Bangalore. The moment I stopped assuming that what worked yesterday would work tomorrow, my entire approach changed. That lesson applies even more in business today. Every company has an alternate version of itself waiting to be built, and it is better to build it internally than be forced to respond to it externally.

The ones who stay paranoid in the right way usually stay relevant.",2025-11-26T04:55:40.990Z,No,"urn:li:comment:(activity:7399288320708698112,7399309850922430464)",0,No,No,

When you build something from scratch, you realize how quickly things can change. 

Reinventing yourself before the market forces you to is honestly the only safe path.

It's about starting rather than losing your idea to someone who started before you. The only difference between someone who wins and someone who loses is that the winner starts early instead of waiting on for some perfect plan.
