Helping companies build strong tech teams and grow faster. 26 years in sales.,comment,"What struck me reading this was how AI has changed the speed of investing, but not the stakes for founders. From the operator side, you feel this shift every day. Markets get analysed faster, due diligence gets tighter, competitive gaps show up instantly.

But none of that changes how lonely execution feels when you are the one signing payroll, correcting strategy midweek or making decisions with incomplete data. That part is still painfully human.

In my own journey, the companies and leaders I’ve admired most were not the ones with perfect metrics but the ones who could stay steady when the environment changed around them. AI has taken a lot of guesswork out of evaluating markets. It has taken none of the guesswork out of evaluating people.

Maybe that is why the best investors I’ve met don’t just look for conviction. They look for founders who can hold their ground when the world gets noisy.",2025-11-25T04:24:49.992Z,No,"urn:li:comment:(activity:7398555976586616832,7398939699412635650)",0,No,No,
