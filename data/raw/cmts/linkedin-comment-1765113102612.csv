I hope this message finds you well. My name is Somasekhar Reddy, and I am the founder of SSH Short Stay Hotels, an innovative app dedicated to hourly hotel bookings in India. Our mission is to address the growing demand for flexible and affordable lodging options, allowing travelers to book rooms by the hour—perfect for quick rests, business meetings, or layovers.

As we are currently in the pre-seed stage, we are eager to connect with forward-thinking investors like Sharp Venture Partners, who have a strong focus on Hotel & Hospitality Tech. I believe our solution not only saves customers money but also helps hotels maximize occupancy.

I would love the opportunity to discuss how SSH can fit into your investment portfolio.

Best regards,
