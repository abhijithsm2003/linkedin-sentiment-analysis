Moats are good for a castle. Not for an airplane.

An anchor is great to have for a ship at shore.

Now it is more about how product/service feel to the end customers.

for eg: People trust Tata/Reliance but when it comes to tech platforms people prefer zepto/blinkit/instamart over bigbasket/jiomart and same in the case of lenskart vs titan eye plus.

Companies who will cater better will outperform the legacy players if legacy players keep on thinking that trust is the only sufficient thing to convince people.  ",2025-10-19T05:44:19.615Z,Yes,"urn:li:comment:(activity:7379719354130657280,7385551353630089216)",0,No,No,
