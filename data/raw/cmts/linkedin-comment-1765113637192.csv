A founder’s energy isn’t just fuel; it’s the organisation’s operating system. It sets the rhythm of decision-making, the tone of execution, the depth of resilience. When the founder stays grounded in chaos, the team builds courage. When the founder radiates purpose, the culture compounds conviction. But when the founder burns out, the company’s momentum burns with them.
The irony is that many leaders guard balance sheets but neglect their own bandwidth. They track KPIs but ignore their internal state. Yet energy — more than any metric — dictates whether a company survives the grind or gets consumed by it.
The most enduring founders I’ve seen are those who treat their energy like capital: protected, replenished, and invested with intention. They understand that clarity doesn’t come from caffeine or chaos — it comes from a well-managed mind and a disciplined spirit.
Because at the end of the day, where energy flows, culture follows. And where culture flows, companies scale.

The more they do this the more relevant their organization would be and would always be a step ahead of their competition. 

The purpose of a business in my opinion is to keep a customer, money and profits are a natural outcome of this. #myexperience
