We love stories of overnight success, but consumer behaviour doesn’t follow venture timelines. It follows trust cycles. And trust in India — across its languages, regions, and value systems — doesn’t scale in months. It compounds in years.
The reality is that a consumer business here isn’t competing only with other brands — it’s competing with habits formed over generations. The dal brand your grandmother used. The soap your father bought. The kirana store that knows your family by name. And changing those choices isn’t a “growth hack.” It’s an emotional marathon.
The real skill, as you rightly said, is reading the signal: is the slope slow because the flywheel hasn’t kicked in yet — or because the customer doesn’t care? Because one requires patience, the other requires a pivot. And that judgment call is what separates a ₹100 Cr brand from a ₹10 Cr one.
In India, the long game isn’t a luxury. It’s the only game worth playing.

Everyone celebrates “abnormal quick growth,” but hardly anyone talks about sustainable practice. Building habits and loyalty takes time — whether you’re a D2C brand or even a platform like Zomato, Zepto, or Uber that ultimately still depends on people and mature processes.
