 At Vayu Lifestyle, people often ask why we chose active-lifestyle accessories over glamorous activewear. 

Our answer: customers care about everyday essentials that solve real problems—comfort, durability, price—especially across Tier-2/3 markets. 

Glamour looks great in a pitch deck, but process + disciplined execution + patience build lasting businesses. 

We’re choosing the slow, repeatable path: learn, iterate, scale — not chase trends. 💡",2025-10-02T04:07:27.140Z,No,"urn:li:comment:(activity:7373196368250757120,7379366380627750912)",0,No,No,

This is a sharp reminder that categories may attract capital, but they rarely create loyalty. Customers stay only when their real problems are solved.

The irony is that the less glamorous spaces often hold the deepest opportunity, because they touch daily life in ways that hype driven categories never can. Quiet scale usually outlasts noisy trends.

Classic startup fashion victim move. 

Here’s the real talk: your customer doesn’t give a damn about your ‘hot’ label; they care if your product solves their mess. 

The fresh POV: categories are like fashion trends; fleeting and often shallow; but real customers are forever stuck with their problems. So instead of building slides to woo VCs, build solutions that customers can’t ghost. 

Because at the end of the day, it’s product-market fit, not investor clout, that pays rent and fuels growth. Pro tip: stop chasing hype, start chasing real pain.",2025-09-15T06:56:34.396Z,No,"urn:li:comment:(activity:7373196368250757120,7373248347589120001)",0,No,No,

Categories are great for investors, but customers only care about whether their pain disappears. I’ve seen this play out with friends building startups and with myself as well - got caught in the wave of ‘hot sectors,’ but when the buzz cooled, they were left trying to reverse-engineer a real user problem. Some of the most resilient businesses I know never had a sexy category tag; they just solved something painfully obvious, over and over, until they owned the customer’s trust. Totally agree: Build for a person, not for a pitch deck. And if the category emerges later, that’s just a bonus!
