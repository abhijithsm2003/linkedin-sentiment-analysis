At Karma Clothing (a small, founder-led label from Delhi), we’re building pure-cotton kurtis designed for real life: breathable fabrics, honest fits, and yes — real pockets you’ll actually use.

We produce in small batches (no overproduction), keep pricing fair, and obsess over details that make people reach for our pieces again and again.
