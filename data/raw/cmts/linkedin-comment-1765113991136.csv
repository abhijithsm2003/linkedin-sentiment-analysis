At Karma Clothing (a small, founder-led label from Delhi), we’re building pure-cotton kurtis designed for real life: breathable fabrics, honest fits, and yes — real pockets you’ll actually use.

We produce in small batches (no overproduction), keep pricing fair, and obsess over details that make people reach for our pieces again and again.

Perceive it tightly,
explained it brightly,
and I am sure you will deploy this Brightly,
in your domain.

the markets at India,
as you perceived above,
is very complex.
It is paradoxical in many ways,,
each contradiction will lay
immense learning opportunities so to say,
and the businesses from abroad,
who arrive scouting for the unsatiated markets,
get much more in return,
they count the dollars,
but never declare the gains,
in their understanding of marketing science
which surpasses now to put previous one to shame.

Thanks once again, for penning down your ideas,
to India's fame!
