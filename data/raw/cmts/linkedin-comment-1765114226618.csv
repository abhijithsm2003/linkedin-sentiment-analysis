I believe category creation is always and always about disruption and questioning, rethinking and maybe even discarding every minor detail And deeply rooted in frustration and lack of respect for the old ways (think ola, amazon, airbnb, zepto- even the age old pepsodent)

Infact , at my last startup , we created a new category in college education (before getting acquired) and we were at WAR with indian universities including IITs

The non-alcoholic “spirits” category wasn’t created out of thin air — it emerged from a very real consumer need: wanting the rituals, flavors, and social belonging of premium spirits, without the alcohol.

What we’ve seen is less about “creating” a category, and more about reframing an existing behaviour — the aperitif, the cocktail, the celebratory pour — through a different lens. By doing so, we’re not just addressing convenience or distribution, but actually nudging cultural habits around moderation, wellness, and inclusivity.

That, to me, is the essence of category creation: not the headlines, but the quiet, consistent shift in how people choose to drink (or not drink).",2025-09-01T05:28:39.050Z,No,"urn:li:comment:(activity:7368122947603009537,7368152791070015488)",0,No,No,
