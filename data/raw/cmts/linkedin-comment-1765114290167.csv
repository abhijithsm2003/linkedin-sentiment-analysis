The way founders allocate their time really reflects the stage of the company and can make or break growth.

One thing that could also be highlighted is the balance between strategy and execution at each stage.

Growth-stage founders, besides team and culture, need to ensure systems and processes scale effectively.

There are so many things we learn. And its really great journey coming from Struggle  to growth stage now and on bootstrap building 25 team size and reinvest profits in building system now.
