Ultimately, tertiary sales is what counts no matter which channel one chooses to operate in. Faster one is able to understand what makes a customer buy your product , faster you can scale. But in this journey the most critical aspect is the efficacy of the product. Higher the efficacy higher the loyalty thus higher the retention thus higher the scale",2025-09-15T05:32:22.983Z,No,"urn:li:comment:(activity:7363774286278332416,7373227160427384834)",0,No,No,https://www.linkedin.com/posts/rishabhmariwala_india-startups-mindset-activity-7363774286278332416-u43x?utm_source=social_share_send&utm_medium=member_desktop_web&rcm=ACoAAGCcrnQBrKbSa0WbTmL6WkyFlIEj-GhhK0I

In F&B, I’ve seen how chasing speed without fixing unit economics or PAC just multiplies pain. The leak only gets bigger as you scale.
The other layer is clarity on what we’re building for:
→ Value - which compounds through trust, consistency, and customer repeat.
→ Or Wealth - which often chases optics, fast growth, and inflated valuations.
Neither is wrong, but confusing the two is where most founders lose balance. Discipline isn’t just about when to sprint - it’s also about knowing which race you’re running.",2025-08-22T07:49:06.478Z,No,"urn:li:comment:(activity:7363774286278332416,7364564259604791297)",0,No,No,

1. Scaling too quickly - I scaled to 150+ customers within 1st 3 months of launch in my 1st startup, and then it blew! Scaling without perfecting fulfilment is a sureshot route to failure...
2. Building many things - Identify what's going to be the core & go deep in that. It's a big temptation to do multiple things fast in order to capture various markets - totally destroys focus!
3. Hiring fast - 200% chances of disaster! Hire only when convinced of the value add, also more people is NOT equal to more work - in fact, it's the opposite.

So, move fast - no doubt, but do the following first
1. Nail down fulfilment & support
2. Build the core to 90% perfection
3. Keep the team super lean even if it means a few extra days",2025-08-20T05:13:12.478Z,No,"urn:li:comment:(activity:7363774286278332416,7363800250358140928)",0,No,No,
