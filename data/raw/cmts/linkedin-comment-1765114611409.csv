In many markets, compliance is the very path to launch and validation. In others, it becomes the defining factor once the initial buzz fades and the real test of growth begins.

Too often, brands celebrate traction and early validation, only to face compliance issues when they become an obstacle. The truth is, when compliance is built into the DNA of product development, brands can expand across global markets seamlessly without draining resources to patch gaps later.

In the beauty industry especially, sustainable and global growth requires more than hype and habits. It calls for foresight, discipline and the willingness to walk the extra mile during development, rather than waiting to react “when the time comes.”

Compliance may not be glamorous, but it is the invisible force that separates brands that fade after the buzz from those that scale globally with resilience and credibility.",2025-08-18T12:25:40.216Z,No,"urn:li:comment:(activity:7363082917658476544,7363184307323998209)",0,No,No,
