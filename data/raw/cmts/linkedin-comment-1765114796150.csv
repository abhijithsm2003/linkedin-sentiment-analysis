Navinder,Singh,Navinder Singh,https://www.linkedin.com/in/navindersingh23,CEO at Stealth Mode Startup,comment,"Interesting topic here — and the time is right to discuss it before calmness turns into chaos.
Here's my take:
Valuation wasn’t born in the founder’s pitch deck, yet it’s become the default yardstick for startups — often the first question asked, even before the product demo is over.
This obsession didn’t start with founders. It took hold when big consulting firms and investment banks pushed “valuation-led growth” as the norm. Useful for M&A and IPO prep, but that mindset spilled into the early-stage world.
Founders trying to solve real problems were pushed to tell a “valuation story” instead of a value creation one. And when valuation becomes the goal, it distorts priorities — growth at all costs, inflated forecasts, premature scaling.
It’s time to stop placing all the blame on founders. The narrative was shaped by those who benefited most from valuations on paper.
Valuation has its place. But the real scoreboard? Revenue, Retention, and Relevance.",2025-08-06T09:35:19.446Z,No,"urn:li:comment:(activity:7358453201550958592,7358792783920328705)",0,No,No,

Raising high feels like winning until you realise you just raised the bar you have to jump next. I have seen friends raise at great optics but then spend 12+ months playing catch up to their own cap table. That’s a treadmill, not traction.
The best raise with clarity, not ego. Milestones over multiples. Room to grow instead of pressure to perform magic. Valuation isn’t a finish line, it’s the start of a new clock. Make sure it gives you time to build, not burn.
Thanks for the reminder!!! Saving this post. ",2025-08-05T16:42:19.843Z,No,"urn:li:comment:(activity:7358453201550958592,7358537855792533504)",0,No,No,
Paras,Mani,Paras Mani,https://www.linkedin.com/in/parasmani-np,"CEO @ [Coming Soon] | Building Ecosystems, Not Just Startups | Designing Growth Engines Across Markets, Capital & People",comment,"Valuation is a milestone; if you earned it.
Not with decks, dreams, and decibels; but with distribution, data, and demand.
You say $2M at $30M post is irresponsible. I say it's irresponsible only if your company was all bark and no bite.
But if you’ve got the market by its throat,
If you know how to create the narrative and own the outcome,
Then valuation is your playground; and you better play big.
The future doesn’t belong to those who “price for where they are.”
It belongs to those who price for where the market is going; and then drag reality to match it.
Stop training founders to be ""reasonable.""
The next unicorns won’t come from caution.
They’ll come from clarity, conviction, and the courage to bet on themselves before anyone else sees it.
So yeah; valuation is a responsibility.
But it’s also a weapon.
Use it like one.",2025-08-05T15:15:43.361Z,No,"urn:li:comment:(activity:7358453201550958592,7358516060163067906)",0,No,No,
