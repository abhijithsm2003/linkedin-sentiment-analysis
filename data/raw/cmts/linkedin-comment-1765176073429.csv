It is an outcome.”
 In the #Marwari90Code, we say:
 ""Don’t chase the numbers. Chase the nerve that triggers them.""
Richard Branson once said —
 “Business opportunities are like buses, there’s always another one coming. But only insight tells you which one to board.”
A 3rd-gen textile trader in Bikaner once told me:
 “My margins grew only after I started asking my regulars not what they wanted to buy, but why they bought from me.”
He stopped selling sarees. He started curating memories.
That’s when word-of-mouth became windfall.
Insight isn’t a spreadsheet metric. It’s an emotional pattern.
Grateful for this sharp lens, Rishabh bhai.
