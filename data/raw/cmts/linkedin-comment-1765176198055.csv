Product-market fit isn't just a milestone; it’s the foundation. When that’s dialed in, great talent doesn’t have to fix the product... they get to scale it. 💡

While you can't hire someone to ""sell something the market does not want,"" you can hire someone who can help you figure out what the market does want and then build it.   

Also the hire might tell you the fact which founders seldom want to listen and thats  POOR MARKET FIT!!

The nuance is that senior talent isn't just a megaphone; they can be the compass and the mapmaker, especially when the initial direction is unclear or incorrect.
Ultimately, it comes down to how you use senior talent. If you hire them merely to ""amplify your direction"" when that direction is flawed, then yes, it's a wasted effort. 
But if you hire them to collaboratively find the right direction and then lead the charge, they can be an invaluable asset in solving a broken product's fundamental issues.

I guess senior talent (and by seniority I presume experience) should be able to help in designing a product that would meet today's demand or make a product for which demand would arise in foreseeable future (ie anticipating the demand).

For example, Recruitment market these days is cluttered with multiple solutions. Still hiring is noisy, transactional and trustless. Companies are overwhelmed with irrelevant, mass applications
Even great roles get buried under hundreds of random CVs most unvetted, many unfit. Hiring teams spend hours screening, interviewing, and still make bad or culture-misaligned hires. Meanwhile, top professionals want to refer people from their network, but they have majorly access to refer them in their current company. But what if they don't have a role available for their trusted referral in their current company? They check offline -Where do I refer them where it actually helps? That's what Lookin.club is trying to solve by reincarnating the real essence of hiring through trusted referrals, the way it used to happen before the advent of job portals. Its an invite-only platform where top industry professionals not only refer CVs, they actually put their reputation on the line and thinks about overall fit and not just a skill-match",2025-07-10T02:21:02.293Z,No,"urn:li:comment:(activity:7347829223660650496,7348899019932274688)",0,No,No,

it's surprising how many people believe that briging a high profile (the most commonly used metric of a successful professional) will resolve any kind of issue they are dealing with.

The new person maybe able to help you address your product-market fit challenge, if you allow the freedom and take his/her inputs. But you cannot force someone to do great sales when the product is not catering to the market needs. 

I think the three questions you asked here, can help people decide what you really need to do, to find a sustainable solution to your issues.",2025-07-07T05:23:15.513Z,Yes,"urn:li:comment:(activity:7347829223660650496,7347857713579581440)",0,No,No,

Leadership can't salvage a product that lacks resonance. At Doodle, we’ve seen firsthand that product-market fit is not just a milestone, it’s the soul of sustainable growth. 

We didn’t start with just a recipe, we started with a promise, premium handmade candy that connects deeply with customers across India through nostalgia, storytelling, and social impact. From small mom- and-pop stores in Mumbai and (West India) to high-footfall retailers Like ""Raj Mandir"" in Delhi, the pull has been organic, repeat-worthy, and expanding state by state.

We’ve built for delight first, then scaling  through data, distribution intelligence, and a mission that India proudly accepts.
