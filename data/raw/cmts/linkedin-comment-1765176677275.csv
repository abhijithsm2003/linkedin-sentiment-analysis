Sapna,Choudhary,Sapna Choudhary,https://www.linkedin.com/in/sapna-choudhary-dubai,Business Growth • Leadership • Change Management • Digital • Middle East,comment,"I set up and ran a small business for 7 years while working full-time. The business was passion-driven; I didn’t prioritize profit. Luckily, it turned profitable within the first few months. After 7 good years, I could sell it at a great price, and it is up and running to this day. The buyer of the business made an on-the-spot offer and when asked what prompted this he said other businesses he considered to acquire were not profitable. I guess I got lucky. The small scale of the business helped me intuitively manage the cash flow. 
Thankfully, my focus in data analysis shifted from revenue to the bottom line over the years. Scaling certainly helps most businesses, but growth without a solid financial plan is reckless.
