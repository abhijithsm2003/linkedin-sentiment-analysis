Ideally, it should be 3:1 or higher meaning every 1 rupees spent on acquisition should yield 3 rupees or more over the customer's lifetime. CAC payback should be 12 months at max What really moves the needle is how effectively a business drives up-selling and cross-selling, as these increase LTV without adding to CAC.

LTV is yet to be proved and may not happen as expected in the future  -  CAC is here and now.

Final point if you are a D2C brand, the cost or repeat customers is not ZERO. Maybe so for a Swiggy; not for a fashion D2C brand. ",2025-06-11T03:59:34.967Z,Yes,"urn:li:comment:(activity:7338407138114920448,7338414571382026240)",0,No,No,

Though I agree completely with what you wrote Rishabh Mariwala , I want to add here that continued Profit is a function of increasing Topline and reducing Bottomline. 
So increasing AOV per customer automatically reduces CAC through clustering and that's the smartest way to move ahead with increasing LTV over time through smart Sales techniques and ofcourse #trust . 

This inherently is called #brandbuilding
