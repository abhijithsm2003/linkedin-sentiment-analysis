Finding the ONE thing that sticks is what will truly build brand recall. When you try to do too many things and have too many products, you end up with a vague purpose that can never be convincing enough. Pick ONE SKU, launch it and learn from it. Expand into other things after a while. You actually don't need a 5 year plan on a day one, an outline of 6-12 months is enough to begin with and will probably drive success better with a clear set of learnings.",2025-06-09T10:05:08.081Z,No,"urn:li:comment:(activity:7337682371900510208,7337781789794414593)",0,No,No,

Re-Imagining how children engage with content.,comment,May not be true for every category. I was in women's apparel and did an experiment to see customer purchase patterns. One product showing fewer SKUs and the same product with higher SKUs another time. Observation was that they ended buying more when options and SKUs are higher. However they would buy the same basic product which is your best seller but they want to see more options and 1 in 4 end up buying more. They want a drop very frequently. Fast fashion is now in the DNA of shoppers. Yes we don't need to have a lot of different product categories but very few options is not going to cut is my experience.  ,2025-06-09T05:32:33.793Z,No,"urn:li:comment:(activity:7337682371900510208,7337713194938810368)",0,No,No,
