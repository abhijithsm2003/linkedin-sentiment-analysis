Rishabh Mariwala It’s a reminder that innovation isn’t just about ingredients, it’s about solving real moments with clarity and joy. So much white space waiting to be explored in India.

MANSI,GOEL,MANSI GOEL,https://www.linkedin.com/in/mansi-goel-926aa7209,Managing Director Fund Raising & Investor Relations,comment,"Thanks for sharing, Rishabh. You’ve raised some interesting points, but I believe there's still a significant trust deficit when it comes to D2C brands—particularly around the gap between what they claim and what they actually deliver.

During my international travels, I’ve tried many of the types of products you mentioned—different brands, but often the same ingredients and nutritional values. And interestingly, I’ve never once questioned their authenticity. For instance, just two days ago in Slovenia, I picked up a coconut-based probiotic yoghurt from a local grocery store. It was delicious and left me feeling genuinely satiated.

But in India, the scenario feels very different. Adulteration and misleading claims are unfortunately common. The regulatory oversight, especially from bodies like FSSAI, seems weak or practically absent. This lack of enforcement creates an environment where entrepreneurs can prioritize profits over consumer well-being—sometimes at the cost of public health.

So the real question is: in a system with minimal checks and balances, who is accountable for ensuring that products sold to consumers are safe, authentic, and truly what they claim to be?",2025-06-03T19:23:20.764Z,No,"urn:li:comment:(ugcPost:7335203309059735552,7335747941095108609)",0,No,No,

It’s founders not wanting to take risks and try something far left. They mostly want to fit into a box that’s been created and stay there

I’ve been on the pitching new ideas side and even when we pitch one tangential and one safe - safe mostly wins

To my surprise they had a new makhana / foxnut brand displayed prominently on the top shelf in 4 different flavors. 

It was cheaper than the market leader I'm used to picking up in Delhi, and as per the shop owner was selling more than he ever expected. It was such a delight, a well crafted product, at the right place and price.
