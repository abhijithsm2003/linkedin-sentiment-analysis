Many new generation companies would like to be a part of Marathon or would like to ring the bell quickly within a couple of years. This expectation is like a now-a-days quick commerce delivery of Blinkit or Zepto.

Just by paying high efficiency can't be purchased. Trust, Ownership and understanding every minute operational Know-How will align every Individual towards the Core Values. Core Values are Fixed Asset they shouldn't be changing as per the market changes they are the foundation where people would have believed in your vision to support you for your success.",2025-06-08T17:09:34.608Z,Yes,"urn:li:comment:(activity:7333391684677824512,7337526216284852224)",0,No,No,
