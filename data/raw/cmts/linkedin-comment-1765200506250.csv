And walking away! 
Just wrote a story on Kairos- the perfect moment to let go

Because sometimes the bravest thing isn’t holding on  it’s knowing when to let go.

This journey took me through cities, love, strangers, and silences… only to bring me back to myself.

Movement became medicine. Places became mirrors. Every letting go was a return.
