Ltd.,comment,"This hit hard Rishabh. For a long time, I thought being “authentic” meant things would get easier but in reality, it meant learning to stand firm when it would’ve been simpler to blend in. 

Whether it’s how you think, create, lead, or speak distinctiveness takes work. But over time, I’ve realized: the cost of fitting in is far greater than the cost of standing out.

Hold the line. It’s worth it.",2025-06-07T06:13:55.583Z,No,"urn:li:comment:(activity:7331273876192022528,7336998828589404160)",0,No,No,https://www.linkedin.com/posts/rishabhmariwala_leadership-inspiration-mindset-activity-7331273876192022528-fn99?utm_source=social_share_send&utm_medium=member_desktop_web&rcm=ACoAAGCcrnQBrKbSa0WbTmL6WkyFlIEj-GhhK0I

What often gets missed is that distinctiveness demands structure, not just spirit.
It's not enough to “be yourself” once. You have to design your routines, relationships, and environments to protect what makes you different.

That could mean saying no to safe roles, resisting groupthink in meetings, or
choosing solitude when noise feels easier. And yes, it often comes at the cost of popularity, predictability, or even short-term progress.

But long-term impact rarely comes from those who blend in. It comes from those who stay rooted in their difference—especially when it’s inconvenient.
The real question isn’t “how do I stand out?”

It’s “what am I willing to sacrifice to stay true?”",2025-05-31T16:26:59.488Z,No,"urn:li:comment:(activity:7331273876192022528,7334616396410105856)",0,No,No,

This is a powerful reflection. Yes, the world constantly nudges us toward the comfort of conformity — but real growth lies in resisting that pull. As your daddy Mr. Harsh rightly said, “You need to have the courage to go against the tide, to innovate, and to stay true to your convictions.”
Being distinctive is not easy. As a mentor, I often remind young minds: originality isn’t about being loud — it’s about being authentic, consistent, & value-driven, even when no one notices. Mr.Ratan Tata once said, “I don’t believe in taking the right decisions. I take decisions & then make them right.” That’s what being distinctive truly demands — conviction, resilience, & humility. We must create more than we consume, uplift more than we compete, & build quietly while the world watches loudly.because in the end, ""it’s not about being different for the sake of it — it’s about making a difference.""",2025-05-25T05:40:11.964Z,No,"urn:li:comment:(activity:7331273876192022528,7332279298663276544)",0,No,No,
