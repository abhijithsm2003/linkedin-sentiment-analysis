At Floryo , we're not just tweaking the traditional model—we're turning it on its head. Leveraging technology, we've built a demand-driven system where finished goods inventory is virtually zero. In fact, we might be the only company in the FMCG space operating at scale with zero FG inventory.

We don't manufacture and then sell—we sell, and then manufacture.😊

This inversion of the conventional approach offers a “fresh” take on Just-In-Time (JIT). While early-stage operational efficiency can take a hit, scale quickly neutralizes that. More importantly, the elimination of dead inventory and locked working capital creates a significant strategic advantage.

Now it’s a winter wear. The stock added was almost at end of sale season. Usually winter sales for sweatshirts & hoodies continues to have its peak till December mid & slows down by Jan first half.
