In fact, some of us started in the winter—and have been building ever since. At Enigma Automobiles, we never had the luxury of capital abundance. We had to make every rupee work—because there was no safety net. Unit economics weren’t buzzwords, they were survival. Capital productivity wasn’t a KPI, it was day-to-day reality. Supply chain strength wasn’t optional, it was the only way forward. While many raised to survive the winter, we built to survive every season. 
Because real brands aren’t made when capital is cheap.
They’re made when every decision feels like it could break you… but you build anyway. How many here have actually lived this??
