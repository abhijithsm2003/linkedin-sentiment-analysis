You may have noticed that there are very few trash cans in public spaces in Japan - people just manage their own trash! Reminds me of some conversations I have had about litter in Indian cities which are promptly blames on the MCD (not enough trash cans, not enough pick up vans, etc etc); we completely ignore our personal responsibility and always making it someone else's problem to address, preferring to look the other way instead of simply not littering the very places we step through also 😓 ",2025-04-24T16:02:44.470Z,No,"urn:li:comment:(activity:7319941566402338816,7321201942595063808)",0,No,No,

This write up absolutely resonated…wrote about an incident last week in Japan that altered my son’s world view…
Wrote about it:

The Cashier and the Code

Some truths don’t arrive with thunder; 
They arrive in steam rising from a bowl, 
In the silence between a gesture and a glance.
Some days, you don’t plan on witnessing grace
You simply stumble into it, hungry, tired, and entirely unprepared.
And yet, it stays with you longer than the meal itself.

Each word speak volumes of the culture.
Undoubtedly you will fall in love with Japan upon visiting it.
I am still awestruck after a decade of visit to that country.
But then:
1) A population of meager 0.1245 billion v/s a humongous 1.4 billion.
2) Children are taught the sense of cleanliness right during school days.
How many us will allow our children to sweep roads and neighhood.
3) Punctuality is taught while still in the cradle.
Don't we frown out loud when our child is punished for being late.
We brag on not being on time, curse the government on not getting the things done.
We oppose all the laws made, industries flout regulations left, right and centre.
It's for us to make the change, make a beginning, kick start a revolution.
Each one of us need to be an agent of change and ask ourselves the next time, we in our individual or professional capacity, mock and scoff the rules in place which we generously do at our convenience for our personal and professional benifit.
Coworker first, neighbour first, society first, country first must be engraved while we are young.
A huge collective responsibility, vigour, determination is needed at each step of citizenship to reach somewhere near Japan",2025-04-21T10:58:55.811Z,Yes,"urn:li:comment:(activity:7319941566402338816,7320038322460839936)",0,No,No,
