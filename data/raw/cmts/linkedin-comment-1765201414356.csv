Rishabh Mariwala You are right on the capacity growing ahead of marketing, but it's all about the balance. Excess capacity also eats margins from lower production efficiency, overstocking, goods lost from damage and expiry,  and capital costs. Whereas slightly slower supply, though at the risk of some customer complaints and loss, can create demand if the product is unique and push the margins.

We’ve figured this piece out—right from raw material sourcing to packaging proximity.
We simplify SKUs by limiting components (1–2 per SKU), which makes procurement and production far more scalable.

We’ve structured our credit cycles to allow repayment flexibility, while staying disciplined enough not to overextend.
We buy what we need, not what we hope we’ll need.
And our marketplace logistics—both shipping and inwarding—are fully dialed in.

We’re bootstrapped, growing YoY, and being frugal has only strengthened our fundamentals.

Interestingly, when we were previously at 50L MRR, we weren’t as sustainable.
That scale exposed the cracks—so we went back to the drawing board and rebuilt a system which can support us as we scale.",2025-04-17T09:37:33.237Z,No,"urn:li:comment:(activity:7318559857328988160,7318568292003037184)",1,No,No,
