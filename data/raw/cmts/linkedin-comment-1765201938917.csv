Chandra,Prakash J.,Chandra Prakash J.,https://www.linkedin.com/in/jatcpg,Marketplace Growth | Cross-Border Trade | Food @Walmart Canada | Ivey MBA,comment,"Loved this post, Rishabh, really resonated with me.

When I started out, I was tempted to chase every channel too. But I chose to focus all my energy on just one platform on one time and committed to doing one product line at a time, even though I was managing multiple categories and brands behind the scenes.

That focus helped me go deep: understanding what drives real growth, building strong customer feedback loops, and figuring out what works operationally. Once I had that clarity, I gradually expanded into other marketplaces, Shopify, and international markets, but always with the mindset of staying lean and deliberate.

That strategy helped me consistently build strong category positions not by being everywhere, but by being intentional and ready to scale when the foundation was solid.

Appreciate you putting this out there, more D2C founders need to hear this.

I’ve seen this first hand, with many brands. 

Mostly these kind of thoughts will be with early stage brands or companies entering D2C for the very first time. They think expanding their brand presence to multiple platforms/marketplaces increases the sales & brand visibility. 

Though it is acceptable to a certain level, I’m afraid of the costs & investment it is demanding. Like purchasing of inventory management tool/software, additional staffing.

Sometimes poor customer experience is inevitable and this will make a customer with bad experience in one platform to repel from that brand on other platforms. 

One big hurdles for brands with multiple market place presence is the inventory tracking and reconciling.",2025-03-28T03:52:36.278Z,No,"urn:li:comment:(activity:7311216915585101824,7311233725348921344)",0,No,No,

If D2C brands focus on building and growing their own website, it will lead to a more profitable and sustainable journey.  

Relying too much on marketplaces comes with major downsides: inventory mismanagement, loss of customer trust, and high commission fees that eat into profits. Marketplaces are ultimately strengthening their own brand by selling vendor products with zero risk, while brands bear the entire burden of returns and refunds.
