Just last week, I met with an investor, and during our conversation, we landed on an interesting point: Jaagruk Bharat might actually be self-sustainable in a few months. Their response? “Then why would you even need external capital?”

And honestly, that made me pause.
There’s a fine line between becoming self-sustaining and truly profitable — and for us, that line is all about deepening user experience, delivering more value, and building a product customers genuinely love and return to.
For companies like ours, funding should be a catalyst — not a crutch. It's not about chasing valuations; it's about creating value.
