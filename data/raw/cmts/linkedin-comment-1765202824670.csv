Sudhir,Kumar,Sudhir Kumar,https://www.linkedin.com/in/sudhir-kumar09,Founder at PRIMEFRAME | Driven by Purpose,comment,"Rishabh Mariwala I strongly believe that our current Prime Minister Narendra Modi is not competent to lead a young and dynamic nation like India. 

His leadership has failed on multiple fronts—Manipulated elections, PM CARES fund opacity, internal security failures at the China border, violence in Manipur despite low population, rising crimes against women, stock market manipulation via exit polls, increasing farmer suicides, control over the President’s office, negligence toward soldier safety, bureaucratic and ECI interference, Supreme Court influence, train accidents, growing corruption, rising black money, worsening poverty, countless COVID deaths with hidden data, suppression of media and citizens’ voices, misuse of agencies, and and serving the interests of a few while neglecting the common people. 

I have explained in detail why he must resign, and it is time for India to have a leader who truly works for the people and the nation's progress. We need change.

Simply put - Historically, great businesses were built by creating a valuable product or service and selling it at a margin to create healthy sustainable growth. The flood of venture capital arguably disrupted this, shifting focus from sustainable business fundamentals to chasing valuations and funding rounds.

Perhaps the lifespan of companies is also an indicator of this reduced level of innovation and drive:
•	1965: Companies remained on the S&P 500 for an average of 32 years.  

	•	Forecast for 2028: Projections suggest that the average tenure will shrink to 12 years.
 
Whilst being well-funded isn’t inherently a problem, an overabundance of capital often leads to complacency, inefficiencies, and reduced innovation—ultimately increasing the risk of failure. This reset in the market might just spark a return to real value creation, separating those driven by 💸 from those genuinely committed to building game-changing products and services.",2025-03-12T04:01:26.228Z,Yes,"urn:li:comment:(activity:7305422286445027346,7305437742270717952)",1,No,No,

First, it demanded “scale or die,” pushing founders into unsustainable expansion. Now, it demands immediate profitability, starving even promising startups of capital. This pendulum swing exposes a lack of conviction and strategic thinking. True ecosystems are built on patient capital, not reactionary funding cycles. Investors must balance ambition with discipline, rather than oscillating between hype and fear. Otherwise, India risks losing its most innovative founders to markets that understand the long game.

It's just that, earlier, only the loud ones that splurged were the only ones getting attention.

Now, the attention is shifted to be more balanced.

The startups that mistook capital for strategy are feeling the chill, while the ones that treated money as fuel, not life support, will endure. There’s a lesson in Japan’s post-war economic rise, companies like Toyota and Sony didn’t just chase scale, they mastered efficiency, lean operations, and built products people actually wanted. The result? They thrived for decades, not just funding cycles.

I feel startups today need to think the same way. Valuations don’t build companies, resilience does.",2025-03-12T03:25:18.507Z,No,"urn:li:comment:(activity:7305422286445027346,7305428650189811712)",0,No,No,
