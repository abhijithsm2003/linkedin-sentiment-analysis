They shift consumer behaviour rather than chase it. They build new expectations rather than optimise old ones. They are not fighting for percentage gains. They are imagining a world that works differently.\n\nIndia is entering a phase where the biggest opportunities lie in categories that do not fully exist yet. Health, food, sustainability, supply chain, personal care, climate, financial wellbeing. Consumers are changing faster than the categories built to serve them.\n\nIf you are building today ask yourself a simple question.\nAm I entering someone else’s race or creating a new one?\n\nThe companies that lead the next decade will be the ones that choose the second path.\n\n\n#startups #consumer #impact #strategy #growth",

  "text": "India’s venture ecosystem is maturing fast, yet one pattern is becoming harder to ignore. The gap between companies that scale into category leaders and the broader pool of VC backed startups is widening.\n\nGlobally, data shows that unicorns command post money valuations anywhere from 3x to 10x higher than closely matched peers. This premium emerges as early as the seed stage and continues across every round in the lifecycle.\n\nIn India, the trend points in the same direction even if the numbers are less granular. We now have more than 100 unicorns with a combined valuation above US 360 billion. Their scale and momentum place them in a different league from the average startup raising venture capital.\n\nSomething else is shifting. The time it takes to reach unicorn status has doubled. In 2024, the average timeline stretched to about 11 years, compared to roughly 5.5 years just a year earlier. This tells us that the companies breaking through today are doing so with far more resilience, clarity and durability built into their model.\n\nWe also know the broader funding environment in India has tightened. Deal volumes and average round sizes dropped meaningfully in 2023, making outperformance even harder to achieve.\n\nPut together, the message is clear. Becoming a VC backed company in India is no longer the differentiator. Becoming an outlier is.\n\nThe next decade in Indian venture will belong to the companies that choose to play at that level from day one.\n\n\n#India #Investing #VC #Future",

Those early years shaped everything I know about resilience, uncertainty and the quiet realities of building from scratch.\n\nAlong the way, I discovered investing and began to understand founders from both sides of the table. \n\nTheir courage, their doubts, and their determination felt familiar because I had lived that journey myself.\n\nThat is why Ideabaaz matters to me.

  "text": "Every strong business has an emerging challenger, even if you cannot see them yet.\n\nSuccess often brings comfort. Comfort creates blind spots. That is usually when disruption enters quietly.\n\nIndia has seen this play out up close. The taxi market had operated the same way for years. Fragmented, offline, resistant to change. Uber arrived with a simple idea and reshaped consumer behaviour across the country. The incumbents were larger and more established. Uber imagined a different future and moved before anyone else realised what was shifting.\n\nThe pattern is familiar. Disruption rarely begins with size. It begins with someone willing to question the assumptions everyone else accepts.\n\nIf there is a product, service or model that could challenge your business, someone is already exploring it. The smarter move is to build that version of your company from within before it comes from outside.\n\nMomentum favours the ones who act early.\n\n\n#strategy #startups #innovation",

You show respect for the craft. You show that you have taken the time to study what worked, what failed and why the market looks the way it does today.\n\nEvery sector has a trail of earlier attempts. Some were ahead of their time. Some collapsed under the wrong model. Some were limited by technology that has only now matured. When a founder can explain these patterns with clarity, it immediately changes the conversation.\n\nInvestors pay attention to that level of awareness. It shows discipline. It shows judgment. It shows that you are building with intelligence rather than ego.\nThe fastest way to lose a room is to pretend history does not matter. Saying you are better than everyone who tried before you is not confidence. It signals a lack of curiosity.\n\nThe founders who study their space deeply always stand out. They build sharper products.

  "text": "The real challenge with change lies in staying with it.\n\nAfter a Vipassana meditation retreat, I returned with a clear mind and deeper awareness. Mornings felt calmer, conversations felt more intentional, and each day carried a quiet sense of balance. For a while, that feeling stayed.\n\nThen the pace of work, travel, and decision-making took over. That calm began to fade into the background.\n\nIt taught me something important. Change is not a single moment. It is a daily practice. The spark begins the journey, but structure helps it last.\n\nHere are five ideas that have helped me sustain it over time.\n\n1. Let it shape who you are.\nWhen a practice becomes part of your identity, it stays. Mindfulness stopped being something I did. It became a way of being in how I lead, think, and respond.\n\n2. Design for it.\nHabits thrive when the environment makes them easy. Small cues like starting the morning in silence, keeping time away from screens, or pausing between meetings make a big difference.\n\n3. Build accountability.\nSharing goals and progress with people who value similar growth helps you stay consistent. Growth feels lighter when it is shared.\n\n4. Accept the rhythm of life.\nDisruptions are inevitable. The key is to return quickly without guilt or frustration. The return matters more than the slip.\n\n5. Reflect often.\nA few quiet minutes each week to notice what worked and what did not can reset your focus and direction.\n\nChange that lasts is rarely dramatic. It grows through repetition, awareness, and small steady choices that align with who you want to become.\n\n\n\n#life #inspiration #growth #mindset #gratitude",

  "text": "Early stage investing teaches you to pay attention to rhythm. Companies grow through daily habits, weekly reflection, and the consistency that comes long before scale shows up on a chart.\n\nFounders who sustain momentum often share a quiet quality. They stay centered when the situation shifts. They learn from customers with curiosity instead of defending their original idea. They treat feedback as fuel. Their clarity is steady, not loud.\n\nThere is always a moment in a conversation where the belief becomes visible. It may appear in how they describe the user, the problem, or the journey so far. It may be subtle, yet it carries conviction. That signal matters more than presentation polish or vocabulary.\n\nThe role of a good partner in this journey is simple. Ask questions that sharpen direction. Create space for clearer thinking. Hold attention on what truly drives progress rather than what creates noise.\n\nLong term value grows when clarity meets patience. Growth expands from the inside outward.\n\n\n#Startups #Leadership #Investing",

Market noise creates momentum, and momentum can easily be mistaken for insight.\n\nOver time, I have learnt to pause and ask one question before every decision. What evidence have we earned, and what are we assuming. That single distinction separates clarity from consensus.\n\nIn early-stage investing, stories are easy to find. The real edge lies in process. Speak to customers, understand their patterns, and listen to what they value. Study the P and L until the numbers reveal where the business truly stands. Test the distribution logic until it works under pressure. Only then does conviction hold weight.\n\nFounders who follow this approach build companies that endure. Investors who practise it make decisions they can trust through every market cycle.\n\nHype fades quickly. Discipline lasts longer and compounds quietly.\n\n\n#VentureCapital #Investing #Entrepreneurship #Leadership #Startups #ConsumerBrand",

Retail is fragmented, cultures shift every few kilometres, and buying behaviour changes with seasons, festivals, and even weather patterns.\n\nFounders who succeed here understand these nuances early. They adapt formats, pricing, and distribution to local realities. They design SKUs that fit quick commerce baskets. They build loyalty through cultural rituals that matter to their audience. They empower field teams whose relationships and reputation drive trust in smaller towns.\n\nIndia rewards founders who respect complexity. When strategy aligns with cultural truth, customer acquisition costs fall, retention improves, and working capital begins to breathe.\n\nEvery quarter, I ask one question. \n\nWhat have we done that makes our distribution harder to copy. The answer to that shapes long-term advantage.\n\n\n#India #VentureCapital #ConsumerBrands #Entrepreneurship #Distribution #Leadership #Growth",

  "text": "Brand is Affinity, not Awareness\n\nAwareness can be created through campaigns. Affinity must be earned through experience.\n\nEvery consumer brand starts with visibility, but the real journey begins after the first purchase. Repeat purchase is the true brand score. It reflects trust, habit, and emotional connection.\n\nIn a market like India, building affinity is about consistency in small details. The flavour that never disappoints. The packaging that feels familiar in a crowded shelf. The service that solves a problem quickly without friction. These are the quiet cues that make a brand part of a customer’s life.\n\nWhen we evaluate consumer companies, we look for signals of this emotional durability. High retention rates, repeat purchases, and community-led growth all point to affinity. They show that the brand has moved from being a product to becoming a preference.\n\nGreat brands win twice. \n\nFirst in the market, then in the mind. \n\n\n\n#Brand #ConsumerInsights #VentureCapital #Entrepreneurship #CustomerExperience #Leadership",

Both demand courage, self-belief, and the ability to turn imagination into impact.\n\nEarlier this month at the ASCENT Conclave, that connection came alive when Pratik Gandhi took the stage. In front of 700 entrepreneurs, he brought his journey to life through the characters he has played. He spoke of how each role taught him something different about patience, discipline, vulnerability, and purpose. It was storytelling at its best, deeply personal yet universally relatable.\n\nFor the #Ideabaaz team, being part of this gathering felt truly special. The energy in the room captured what the show stands for - the passion, struggle, and resilience that define every entrepreneur.\n\nA heartfelt thank you to Raj Nayak, Jeet Wagh and Mudit Kumar for building such a powerful platform that celebrates these stories. \n\nIt has been a privilege to share this journey with my fellow Titans Jimmy Mistry, Sandesh Sharda, Simron Mohapatra, Shaili Chopra, Priyanka Salot, Archana Jahagirdar, Anupam Bansal, and Arjun Vaidya.\n\n\n\n#India #Entrepreneurship #Inspiration #Growth #Future",

  "text": "Entrepreneurship is a mindset.\n\nIt begins with an idea, but it thrives on resilience, curiosity, and the courage to keep moving forward even when the path is uncertain. Every founder’s journey is different, yet the spirit that drives them is the same, the desire to create something that endures.\n\nThat spirit is what #Ideabaaz celebrates.\n\nThe show gives founders across India a platform to share their journeys in their own languages. It captures the raw energy of entrepreneurship that exists in every town, every city, and every dreamer who believes in building rather than waiting.\n\nThis is storytelling with purpose, stories that inspire, teach, and show us that innovation is not limited to metros or boardrooms. It lives wherever people have the courage to act on their ideas.\n\nEpisode 1 premieres today on Zee Tv and ZEE5.\n\nGratitude to Raj Nayak, Jeet Wagh, Mudit Kumar and Kailash Gandhi for bringing this vision to life. Your work has created a space where every idea has a voice.\n\nIt has been an honour to share this journey with an inspiring group of Titans, Jimmy Mistry, Archana Jahagirdar, Anupam Bansal, Arjun Vaidya, Priyanka Salot, Simron Mohapatra, Shaili Chopra and Sandesh Sharda. Each brings a unique perspective on what it means to build with purpose and intent.\n\nPratik Gandhi has been a phenomenal host for the show. \n\nIdeabaaz is a celebration of belief, creativity, and possibility. It reflects the strength of India’s founders and the collective drive that continues to shape our future.\n\n\n#India #Entrepreneurship #Future #Inspiration #Growth #Success",

  "text": "A family office operates differently. It can think across decades, observe patiently, and act with precision. The capital is patient, yet the intent is sharp. \nFlexibility allows it to explore funds for insights, co-invest when conviction is strong, and support founders through both growth and correction cycles.\n\nFor me, every investment begins with three questions:\n ✅ Is the founder’s drive visible in the way they build?\n ✅ Are the unit economics sound enough to sustain scale?\n ✅ Does the distribution network become stronger with time?\n\nAccess to diverse funds and partnerships brings intelligence, but decisions rest on one core principle. Do we truly understand the customer’s behaviour well enough to anticipate where demand will move. When that clarity exists, conviction follows naturally.\n\nThe advantage of a family office lies in its ability to combine patience with precision. It can move quickly when required, yet stay committed when markets fluctuate. That balance creates lasting value for founders, for partners, and for the ecosystem it believes in.\n\n\n#FamilyOffice #Investing #VentureCapital #Entrepreneurship",

Distribution is a day one question. Channels create truth.

Local networks that move inventory on time. A sales motion that Tier 2 retailers trust. Partnerships that lower unit economics as you scale. Nail this and the feedback loop compounds in your favour.\n\nWhen I meet a consumer startup, I first ask how they plan to win shelf space in the mind and in the market. Product can create interest.

  "text": "When your legacy becomes your launchpad.\n\nLast weekend at the ASCENT Conclave, in a conversation with Aditi Kothari Desai, we spoke about leadership and legacy. The idea that what you inherit can be both a foundation and a test.\n\nIt is easy to take comfort in what already exists. The safety of a family name. The familiarity of systems that work. Yet legacy means little if it does not evolve. Every generation has a choice; to preserve what was or to reimagine what could be.\n\nHere is what I keep coming back to:\n👉 The blueprint you inherit is only a starting point\n 👉 True leadership is measured by what you add, not what you maintain\n 👉 Conviction matters more than comparison\n 👉 Playing safe may protect the past but it rarely builds the future\n\nTo anyone who has grown up around success, remember this. Legacy is not a shield. It is a challenge. The real privilege is having the chance to create your own story within it.\n\nHere’s to those who build forward, not backward.\n\n\n#India #Entrepreneurship #FamilyBusiness #Legacy",

  "text": "Why second-time founders move differently.\n\nWhen I meet second-time founders in India, there is one consistent difference. They are ruthless about saying no.\n\nFirst-time founders try to do it all. Launch in multiple cities at once. Chase every distribution partnership. Hire for functions they do not need yet.\n\nSecond-time founders cut faster. They know distraction is more dangerous than competition. One retail pilot at a time. One core SKU before the catalogue expands. They do not confuse activity with progress.\n\nThis discipline is not cynicism. It is clarity born from scar tissue.\n\nIf you want to think like a second-time founder, start asking yourself: what will I regret spending time on a year from now?\n\n\n\n#india #startups#growth#future #inspiration #success",

The first D2C brands in categories like beauty or personal care are not the ones leading today.\n\nWhy? Because the market does not reward pioneers. It rewards those who execute, who adapt, who understand the customer deeply and scale patiently.\n\nThe founder who listens to their customer will always beat the founder who rushes to be early.\n\nIf you are spending more time worrying about competitors than about whether your customer is coming back, you are fighting the wrong battle.\n\nFirst mover advantage is a headline.

Talent management.\nBut what I watch most closely is energy management.\n\nIn India, where building often feels like a marathon through roadblocks compliance, infrastructure, shifting consumer behaviour, the founder’s energy is the single biggest variable. If you stay calm through chaos, the team rallies. If you are frantic even in routine, the team cracks.\n\nEnergy is contagious. Investors sense it in reviews. Employees absorb it daily. Customers feel it in your brand voice.\n\nThe best founders treat their energy as an asset. They protect it, renew it, and deploy it with intention.\n\nWhere energy flows, everything else follows.\n\n\n#india #startups #entrepreneurship #mindset #growth #productivity",

But my first question is always the same. Who is your customer?\n\nBecause categories are investor constructs. Customers do not think in categories. They think in problems.\n\nIn India, I have seen founders chase “hot” tags like edtech or BNPL because capital was flowing, only to realise that retention and monetisation were weak once the initial hype wore off. \n\nAt the same time, I have seen businesses solving everyday challenges like affordable protein or efficient distribution in Tier 2 towns not glamorous categories, but deeply needed. They scaled quietly, sustainably.\n\nIf your customer does not care about the category, then neither should you.

  "text": "The myth of “category creation.”\n\nEvery founder dreams of being a category creator. It sounds glamorous. It sounds like legacy.\n\nBut in reality, most categories are not created from scratch. They are reframed. They emerge from solving a real customer pain so well that people start seeing the problem differently.\n\nThink about D2C in India. The strongest brands were not creating new needs. \n\nThey were addressing existing ones in better, more relevant ways convenience, trust, design, distribution.\n\nCategory creation is not about press headlines. It is about changing behaviour. \n\nIf your product is not altering habits, you are not building a new category. You are adding noise to an old one.\n\n\n#india #startups #growth #mindset #success",

  "text": "You can tell what stage a company is in by looking at how the founder spends their time.\n\nIn the early days, most of it goes into product. Sitting with customers, building features, fixing bugs.\n\nAt growth stage, it shifts toward team hiring, training, aligning.\n\nLater, it becomes about capital, partnerships, and external leverage.\n\nThe mistake I see is when founders misalign their calendars. \n\nSeed-stage founders spending most of their week pitching investors instead of building. \n\nSeries B founders still micromanaging features while culture slips through the cracks.\n\nYour calendar is not just about time management. It is a strategy document. If it does not match your company’s stage, you are already behind.\n\n\n#startups #entrepreneurship #strategy #growth #mindset #success",

  "text": "I see founders chase funding because “it’s available” or because “the market is hot.”\n\nThe problem is, when you raise before you are ready, the capital creates expectations you cannot meet. Suddenly you need to grow faster, hire senior talent, expand into new markets. But your product is still figuring out retention.\n\nThis mismatch between capital and capability is what breaks early-stage companies. The pressure pushes founders to make short-term decisions, cut corners, and burn trust with investors.\n\nHere is the truth: there is nothing wrong with waiting. Waiting until your product has depth. Waiting until your early users stay without incentives. Waiting until your numbers tell a clear story.\n\nCapital amplifies whatever is already there. If you are not yet ready, it amplifies chaos.\n\n\n#india #startups #growth #mindset #success",

The time it takes to prove your thesis. The gap between launch and sustainable unit economics.\n\nI meet founders who have product momentum but burn rates that leave them with less than a year to figure out retention, distribution efficiency, and pricing discipline. The product may be strong, but the runway is too short to navigate the learning curve.\n\nThe most resilient founders build with time in mind. They set up supply chains that can scale without breaking margins. They design marketing to grow repeat purchase before expanding reach. They ensure every quarter extends the business’s ability to survive market shocks.\n\nA longer runway is not just safety. It is leverage. It lets you test, adapt, and capture market share with intention instead of desperation.\n\nBefore you chase the next growth spike, ask yourself one question. Will this choice buy me more time to get it right?\n\nIn the consumer space, time well used is often the ultimate competitive edge.\n\n\n#india #startups #consumer #strategy #growth #success",

It is a responsibility.\n\nToo often, I see early-stage founders raise at valuations that feel good in the moment but set them up for trouble later.\n\nYou raise two million at a thirty million post. No revenue yet, but big plans. A year later, you hit three hundred thousand ARR. That is real progress. It is also not enough to justify a significant step-up.\n\nEvery round sets a benchmark. If your valuation outpaces your progress, future funding becomes harder, not easier. Investors begin to question the gap, and the pressure compounds at each stage.\n\nAt Sharrp, we see this pattern repeat. Founders focus on dilution, momentum, and optics. But very few pause to ask what numbers will justify my next round?\n\nThere is no magic in a high valuation unless you grow into it. Otherwise, you are spending more time trying to meet expectations than building your business.\n\nThe best founders do the opposite. They raise what they need. They price for where they are. They set targets they can hit within 18 to 24 months.\n\nAsk yourself one thing before signing your next term sheet.\nWhat will make the next round obvious?\n\nIf you do not have that answer, pause.\n\nBuilding a company is hard. You need space to grow into your potential, not race against it.\n\nBe realistic. Be intentional. That is how real value gets built.\n\n\n#india #startups #entrepreneurship #mindset #valuation #investing",

  "text": "I recently spent time in a space filled with early-stage founders, product thinkers and AI builders.\n\nWhat struck me was not just the pace of innovation, but the mindset everyone seemed to carry.\n\nIt was not loud. It was not performative. It was just real.\n\nHere are five things that stood out to me...\n\n1. Openness is the default. People share what they are building, what they are learning and where they are stuck. There is no fear of someone stealing ideas\n\n2. There is an insane bias toward action. You will not find long debates or polished decks. People move fast, test quickly and adjust in real time\n\n3. Builders get respect early. You do not need credentials or connections. If you are building something useful, you are already in the room\n\n4. Thinking big is the norm. No one is trying to be incremental. Ambition is expected, not admired from a distance\n\n5. The talent density is unmatched. Almost every conversation sharpens your thinking. The energy is contagious and makes you want to raise your game\n\nBeing in that kind of environment rewires how you approach your own work. It reminds you what is possible when people are focused, clear and generous with their thinking\n\nNot all ecosystems are like this. But when you find one, pay attention. It will push you in the right way. \n\n\n#startups #investing #technology #mindset #future #success",

We all know India is a billion-plus population story. That’s not new.\n\nTwo, most founders map the market as it stands today. But the real opportunity is in where it is going, not where it’s been.\n\nThree, the numbers are often stitched together from different sources and categories that don’t align with what you're actually building for.\n\nAnd let’s be honest — a lot of it is cherry-picked, top-down theory with no connection to the real customer or execution on the ground.\n\nI have made the same mistake.\n\nHere’s what works better.\n\nGo bottom up.\n\nStart with what you’ve built. Who is using it. How often. What they are paying. What problem it solves.\n\nThen walk us forward.\n\nWho else this can reach. What categories it can stretch into. How habits and consumption are changing.\n\nThis gives us much more than a market estimate. It shows us how you think about GTM, retention, unit economics, brand, distribution, team, geography — all in one frame.\n\nA grounded slide with real customer behaviour and forward momentum beats theoretical billions every time.\n\n\n#india #startups #investing #funding #growth #consumer #future",

It is the return of discipline.\n\nFounders who raised capital easily in the past are now being asked harder questions. Investors are not pulling away. They are simply moving slower, with more intent.\n\nThis is where resilience shows. Founders who have focused on clarity, frugality, and customer stickiness are still raising. The ones who relied only on pitch decks are facing silence.\n\nThis slowdown is not closing doors. It is revealing which teams are truly prepared to build through cycles.\n\nThe capital is still there.

  "text": "Bharat‑First Founders.\n\nMonth after month, I see the shift in capital and attention back to Bharat.\n\nIn Q1 2025, consumer startups focused on Bharat themes vernacular, convenience, Tier‑2/3 networks accounted for nearly 40 percent of all deals.\n\nRegional language apps are seeing engagement rise over 50 percent year-on-year. \n\nThat is the power of solving for context - shopkeeper routines, local festivities, even how tea arrives at homes in the heartland.\n\nThis is not superficial localisation. It is culture-led product design.\n\nWinning in Bharat means leaning in on:\n• Language flows - creating UI, help, even onboarding in local dialects.\n• Distribution realities - consistency meets motorcycle routes and store trust.\n• Social norms - kitchen culture, familial buying patterns, community rituals.\n\nStartup founders are often encouraged to think global fast. Great, but only after you’ve thought Bharat deep.\n\nCompanies that capture these layers aren’t chasing scale. They are defining scale. The rest become catering slides for VC decks.\n\nCulture is not a feature. It is the foundation.\n\n\n#india #startups #future #growth #success",

A space where learning is shared freely, questions are welcomed, and insights are drawn from real experiences, not just headlines.\n\nThroughout the day, we had the privilege of hearing from leaders who have built, scaled, and shaped some of the most interesting stories in their industries.\n\nWe discussed how AI is changing the way brands approach revenue growth across QComm platforms. Another session broke down what it takes to make retail distribution stronger and more efficient. Very fun and powered packed session which offered a real view into how influencer and celebrity partnerships work when done right.\n\nMr. Harsh Mariwala spoke with depth about what gives an entrepreneur the right to win. We also had two of our incredible team folks at Marico who covered: how AI can be used meaningfully by digital-first brands. Another individual closed the day by helping us see how design thinking can shift the way we understand consumers and innovate with intention.\n\nA special thank you to our portfolio founders for showing up with honesty and clarity - Disha Singh and Pradeep Krishnakumar of Zouk, Ajith Sunny, Ranjit Behera, Prince Thomas of MetaShot and Sanil Bhatia of ESCA Consumer Health.\n\nWe learn as much from your questions as we do from your stories. \n\nTo every founder who joined us, thank you for making the time.

  "text": "It was a privilege to speak at this year’s Vegan India Conference in Mumbai. I have had the opportunity to back several purpose-driven businesses. This platform reinforced why the plant-based movement in India is gaining powerful momentum.\n\nThe Startup Ignite pitch stage was a highlight. Seven impressive startups presented their ideas to a jury of aligned investors. I had the opportunity to be part of that jury along with Siddharth Kothari, Hiren Kara, Ruchika Jain Ⓥ, Punit Mehta, Mudit Jain, Karan Mehta and Yash Biyani.\n\nCongratulations to the two startups recognised for their pitch quality and clarity of thought. ProMeat and Hemptyful stood out for their conviction and clarity. Each of the other finalists — Oatey, nattier!, CURRY N PEPPER LLC, Tempeh Di Mumbai and The Green Meat brought something original to the table and left a mark.\n\nThe energy in the room made one thing clear. India’s plant-based innovation ecosystem is growing not just in size but in maturity. The ideas are sharper. The intent is deeper. The talent is real.\n\nGrateful to Palak Mehta and the organisers for creating a space where ideas, capital and purpose can meet meaningfully.\n\n\n#India #Vegan #Startups #Funding #Growth #Future #Impact",

  "text": "What we are seeing globally today could easily be tomorrow’s India story.\n\nEvery month, we review consumer brands that are innovating across categories, not just in terms of ingredients but also in how they think about format, flavour, and function.\n\nHere are 10 international brands that stood out recently. Each one holds a mirror to where Indian brands could go next:\n\n1. Bask Suncare\nNon-aerosol mineral sunscreen spray. Reapplication made simple.\n👉 India is still warming up to SPF sprays. But formats like this are exactly what will grow the category.\n\n2. Cocojune Products\nCoconut-based probiotic yoghurts. Clean, creamy, plant-forward.\n👉 Alt-dairy in India has potential if we stop chasing soy and start thinking taste-first.\n\n3. Drumroll Snacks\nHigh-protein, low-sugar donuts. Indulgence meets macros.\n👉 Snacking in India still leans clinical or cheat-day. This sits right in the middle.\n\n4. Ella's Flats\nSeed crackers used as snack bases. Crisp, whole, visually vibrant.\n👉 This is a packaging and positioning story waiting to happen in India’s urban centres.\n\n5. Hero Bread\n0–1 net carb bread with protein and fibre. Strong influencer play.\n👉 Indian health bread players can unlock bigger value through branding, not just claims.\n\n6. NUFYX® \nKeto plant protein powders that feel like dessert. Organic, digestible, smooth.\n👉 Plant protein here is gaining traction, but taste is still an afterthought.\n\n7. SAUZ\nFresh pasta sauces with bold ingredients. Focused on flavour, not fear.\n👉 Clean label in India is often too cautious. There is room for brands to lead with confidence.\n\n8. STRANGE WATER\nSparkling coconut water. Same base, new behaviour.\n👉 This is one of the smartest repositioning moves I have seen. India’s coconut water brands can push this.\n\n9. Visitor Beer*\nCrisp non-alcoholic beer with branding that works at bars.\n👉 We are seeing early signs here, but there is a long way to go in taste and occasion mapping.\n\n10. Whims Delights\nOat milk chocolate bites. Vegan, low-sugar, genuinely snackable.\n👉 No one is owning this space in India yet. Huge opportunity.\n\nEach of these brands tells us something: the edge is no longer about ingredients. It is about how clearly you solve a real-world moment with joy, function, and relevance.\n\nTo Indian founders building in food, wellness, or skincare, there is white space waiting to be owned.\n\n\n#India #Branding #Marketing #Packaging #Startups #Future #Trends",

  "text": "As I look back, a few quiet truths have stayed with me. They were not loud lessons. They came slowly, through experience, through stillness, and through choosing to pay attention.\n\n1. Health is the foundation. Everything else is built on it. Without it, even the best plans fall apart. Prioritise it before you are forced to.\n\n2. Time is your most valuable asset. If you give it away too freely, it disappears without return. Invest it with intention. Let it grow into something meaningful.\n\n3. Friendships are among life’s most enduring gifts. The ones that stay without expectation, without performance, are rare. Nurture them with care.\n\n4. Forgiveness is not about forgetting. It is about releasing the weight you were never meant to carry. Forgive early so you can move freely.\n\n5. There is wisdom in walking away. Not every path deserves your presence. Knowing when to step back is strength, not failure.\n\nStill learning. Still walking. Still open to where the road leads next.\nGrateful for all the steps it has taken to reach here.\n\n\n#Life #Inspiration #Reflections",

We are all taught to \"be yourself.\" \n\nWhat I'm really asking you to do is to embrace and be realistic about how much energy it takes to maintain that distinctiveness. \n\nThe world wants you to be typical, in a thousand ways it pulls at you. Don't let it happen. \n\nYou have to pay a price for your distinctiveness, and it's worth it. \n\nThe fairy tale version of \"be yourself\" is that all the pain stops as soon as you allow your distinctiveness to shine. That version is misleading. Being yourself is worth it, but don't expect it to be easy or free. \n\nYou'll have to put energy into it continuously. \n\nBe kind, be original, create more than you consume, and never, never, never, let the universe smooth you into your surroundings.\"\n\n\n\n#Leadership #Inspiration #Mindset #Startups #Success",

More markets.\n\nWhat gets overlooked is whether the backend is ready to handle it.\n\nWe once met a founder who had doubled revenue in one year, but their working capital cycle had stretched to a point where they were chasing growth with no cash in the bank.\n\nIn the rush to win market share, they were losing control.\n\nAt Sharrp Ventures, we do not get excited by speed. We get excited by repeatability.\n\nAre your customers coming back?\nIs your team able to deliver consistently?\nDo your margins hold when discounts are removed?\n\nThese are the questions that build enduring brands.\n\nIf you are building a consumer startup today, ask yourself this:\nCan your operations handle the scale you are chasing?\n\nThe brands that last are the ones that scale their backend as deliberately as they grow their front end.\n\nGrowth is visible.

That conversation sparked an idea - what if we built something together that made this landscape easier to navigate?\n\nOver the past few weeks, Thriverse Advisory and Sharrp Ventures | Harsh Mariwala Investment Office came together to create a tactical playbook on celebrity endorsements designed for founders, marketers, and brand leaders who are working through these decisions in real time.\n\nHere is the complete series:\n\nCelebrity Endorsement Pricing – https://lnkd.in/dPNTXyMM\n\n5 Cost Considerations to keep in mind – https://lnkd.in/dixDApks\n\nShort term v/s Long Celebrity Endorsements – https://lnkd.in/dh5d-x6u\n\nFee v/s Sweat Equity Associations – https://lnkd.in/d6eGevwD\n\nContracts – https://lnkd.in/d7ZXGC8V\n\nSelecting the right celebrity for your brand – https://lnkd.in/dncgVhQM\n\nSmooth execution of a celebrity endorsement campaign – https://lnkd.in/dErhQqTt\n\nThe power of integrated teams – https://lnkd.in/dyknhr95\n\nIf you are building in the consumer space, we hope this gives you a practical lens on what it really takes to get celebrity endorsements right.\n\nLet us know what resonated and what you would like us to explore next.\n\n\n\n#India #Branding #Marketing #Growth #Strategy #Success",

  "text": "In consumer brands, growth signals are loud - new markets, fresh SKUs, investor interest, demand spikes.\n\nWhat is often missing is the discipline to pause.\n\nTo check if your internal systems can support what your ambitions are chasing.\nTo ensure your team is ready, your margins are stable, your supply chain is flexible enough to absorb scale without breaking.\nTo ask whether your product experience is consistent across the shelves that already exist.\n\nGrowth looks exciting externally. Alignment feels steady internally.\n\nThe most resilient brands are not the ones that grow the fastest. They are the ones that know when to hold before they push.\n\nGrowth is a privilege. So is patience.\n\n\n#India #Startups #Consumer #Strategy #Growth #Success",

You can scale a company without scaling judgment. You can hire fast and dilute alignment. You can chase new markets while missing what is broken internally.\n\nStillness is not the opposite of speed.

  "text": "I recently travelled to Japan with my family, and the experience left a mark. It gave me a window into a culture shaped by quiet strength, shared values, and deep-rooted discipline.\n\nHere are a few things that stood out:\n\n1. Respect is central. From how people greet each other to how they conduct conversations, there is a strong sense of mutual respect woven into daily life.\n\n2. Attention to detail is a way of being. Whether it is the way food is plated or how a train platform is marked, everything is done with care and precision.\n\n3. Time is honoured. Punctuality is non-negotiable. Being on time is seen as a sign of respect for others and for your own word.\n\n4. Cleanliness is collective. Public spaces are spotless, not because of rules, but because people take personal ownership of shared environments.\n\n5. Harmony guides behaviour. The focus is on community over individualism. Decisions are made with consideration for how they affect the whole.\n\nThere is a quiet power in this kind of culture. One that makes you pause, observe, and re-evaluate how we live and work. \n\nComing back, I find myself asking - how can we bring some of this clarity, respect, and intentionality into the way we build, lead, and grow?\n\n\n#culture #inspiration #travel #Japan",

It is a signal. The rules of global trade are being rewritten in real time, and the ripple effects will reach far beyond their borders.\n\nIndia will feel this through softened export demand, slower capital flows, and pressure on sectors closely linked to U.S. trade. At the same time, this moment brings a rare opportunity to reposition ourselves in global supply chains.\n\nThis is a window to strengthen India’s role as a trusted partner in manufacturing and technology. It calls for sharper economic diplomacy, policy agility, and a mindset that looks beyond the next quarter.\n\nLeaders who build macro-awareness into their decision-making will be better equipped to navigate what comes next. \n\n\n#india #leadership #business #trade #future",

  "text": "Building a Brand in India? \n\nConsumer brands in India do not scale overnight. The companies that succeed are the ones that understand patience is part of the process.\n\nMost founders overestimate how fast they can grow and underestimate how long it takes to build trust. Unlike tech startups that can scale through code, consumer brands need distribution, word-of-mouth, and a strong reputation.\nIndian consumers have options. They will not commit to a brand unless they see long-term value. \n\nThis means repeatable quality, customer experience, and consistent brand messaging over years, not just viral campaigns and deep discounting.\n\nIf you are building a brand, think about how it will sustain for decades, not just the next quarter.\n\nThe real competition is not other startups.

Now, funding is harder to come by and everyone is talking about a funding winter.\nThe truth is, this is not a downturn. It is a reset.\n\nInvestors are no longer excited by high burn rates and flashy expansion plans. They want to see businesses that are disciplined, efficient, and built for sustainability. A startup that can survive without constant external capital is always in a stronger position.\n\nValuations are a reflection of fundamentals.

Premium brands cannot be priced for mass, and vice versa.\n- What is the psychological price threshold? Rs. 999 feels very different from Rs. 1001.\n\nPricing is strategy, not math.

They saw an opportunity to bring the experience of playing into homes, making it more accessible and engaging. Their passion for the sport and deep understanding of the Indian market shaped a product that fits seamlessly into everyday life.\n\nThis vision came to life on Shark Tank India, where MetaShot not only secured an investment but received twice the amount they asked for.

The MetaShot team left high-paying careers to pursue their love for cricket and build something that resonates with millions. Their approach—blending technology with sport to create shared experiences—is what makes this investment exciting.\n\nMetaShot is Made in India, for the world. It is built for a market where cricket is deeply loved and where affordability matters. The product is strong, the team is relentless, and the opportunity ahead is huge.\n\nExcited to be a part of this journey.\n\nSauce.vc Manu Chandra Panthera Peak Zoeb Ali Khan Nikhil Bhandarkar\n\n\nImage source: IndianRetailer.com\n#india #startup #investing #sports #technology #innovation",

Last-mile delivery remains one of the toughest challenges, particularly in rural and semi-urban areas.\n\nHere are three strategies I have seen work well:\n\n1. Partnering with local entrepreneurs to create micro-fulfillment centers.\n2. Using tech to optimise routes and reduce costs in hard-to-reach areas.\n3. Offering flexibility in delivery options, such as lockers and community hubs.\n\nStartups that innovate around last-mile logistics will not just improve customer satisfaction—they will redefine the standard for convenience in India.\n\n\n\n#india #startups #innovation #ecommerce #future #growth #success",
