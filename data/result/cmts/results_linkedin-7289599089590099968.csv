Dear Rishabh,
I hope you're doing well. I wanted to share some key insights on the Indian hair industry and why this market is on the verge of becoming a $10 billion opportunity.
Currently, all premium hair originates from India, and while the industry remains fragmented, it is clear that major players—including companies like Reliance, HUL, and a few others—will soon step in to consolidate and monopolize it. The demand for high-quality Indian hair is soaring globally, and with the right supply chain control and branding strategy, this can become a billion-dollar business in exports alone.
I’d love to discuss this further and explore how we can align on a strategy to capitalize on this shift before the industry consolidates. Let me know a convenient time to connect.
Looking forward to your thoughts",2025-02-06T09:56:44.416Z,"urn:li:comment:(activity:7289599089590099968,7293205969801486337)",,subject the future of the indian hair industry a b opportunity dear rishabh i hope youre doing well i wanted to share some key insights on the indian hair industry and why this market is on the verge of becoming a billion opportunity currently all premium hair originates from india and while the industry remains fragmented it is clear that major playersincluding companies like reliance hul and a few otherswill soon step in to consolidate and monopolize it the demand for highquality indian hair is soaring globally and with the right supply chain control and branding strategy this can become a billiondollar business in exports alone id love to discuss this further and explore how we can align on a strategy to capitalize on this shift before the industry consolidates let me know a convenient time to connect looking forward to your thoughts,0.035,0.803,0.163,0.9607,Positive
