I would like to add a different view, how about saying the experience that a brand provides through its products defines its value, or to say a client perceives its value. It's completely opposite of what 99.99% brands do sitting inside the board room, discussing pricing strategy! I say it with all authenticity, because India does not have a D2C brand in the global top 64 even after 78 years of Independence, the reason is , legendary brands allow their customers to value their products by providing ""best in class experience"". Legendaries do not care for competition, they disrupt.Their entire model moves around how to better the experience next & when it is about experience,thinking of price is so cheap! I see an urgency, consumer businesses in India need to move beyond winning market share on pricing or product performance, we are in the era of AI, multibrands &ecommerce, brands who are spending money for grabbing an eye ball will not exist 10 years from now, I guarantee! Brand owners in india need to ask one simple question to themselves,is the experience that is pulling customers or their sales person/frenchise, burning midnight oil  and they will have the secret sauce! #PKC",2025-02-22T18:10:57.831Z,"urn:li:comment:(activity:7297109723382706176,7299128551092469761)",,rishabh mariwala thoughts coming from you matters i would like to add a different view how about saying the experience that a brand provides through its products defines its value or to say a client perceives its value its completely opposite of what brands do sitting inside the board room discussing pricing strategy i say it with all authenticity because india does not have a dc brand in the global top even after years of independence the reason is legendary brands allow their customers to value their products by providing best in class experience legendaries do not care for competition they disrupttheir entire model moves around how to better the experience next when it is about experiencethinking of price is so cheap i see an urgency consumer businesses in india need to move beyond winning market share on pricing or product performance we are in the era of ai multibrands ecommerce brands who are spending money for grabbing an eye ball will not exist years from now i guarantee brand owners in india need to ask one simple question to themselvesis the experience that is pulling customers or their sales personfrenchise burning midnight oil and they will have the secret sauce pkc,0.012,0.85,0.137,0.9704,Positive
