I'm afraid your message is confusing and self-contradicting. 

Ideas get attention only at a theoretical level. Not at a Pragmatic / Practical level. 

Unlike the past when consumer behavior was / is shaped by Marketing & Advertising, the future will and should be shaped by experience. Data Continuum (From Creation to Consumption) should play a significant role.

Innovation has three parts - 
1️⃣ Mind to Market (Systemic or Unprecedented where the Customer doesn't know). 
2️⃣ Time to Market (Systems' or Out of the Box Approach to Application) where Theta Customers sitting on the fence adopt.
3️⃣ Continuous Improvement that reduces the transactional costs and therefore increases the customer base. 

What you call Product is essentially in the second and third stages of innovation. But before we get there, startups need to disrupt the marketplace and not just conform to how the grownups have created and sustained the marketplace. Especially in these times when our societies should move from the 200 years of Industrialization legacy to the next 200 years of an Intelligent Life. 

Happy to dialog if you are.
