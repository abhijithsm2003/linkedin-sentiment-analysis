I wish more founders respected the operating system of India - a value-conscious, multi-generational consumer mindset that rewards brands offering consistency over gimmicks.

I wonder how many brands fail because they chase tech startup growth curves, ignoring that FMCG and consumer brands are built through distribution depth, repeatable quality, and ritual adoption.

Insight: 
In India, brands aren’t built, they’re earned - over decades, not quarters.
