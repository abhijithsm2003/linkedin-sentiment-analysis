Deepak Kumar,https://www.linkedin.com/in/deepakbkumar,I know I’ll Win,"Hi Rishabh Mariwala

EdTech didn’t fail—it was just built on the wrong foundation. High CAC, deep discounts, and one-time course sales made it unsustainable.

I’m Deepak Kumar, Co-founder of Edu Tantr, and we’ve solved this. Eduk8 – India’s first OTT for Skills-Based Learning – is already driving revenue from colleges.

🚀 Colleges are already paying – No deep discounts, no unsustainable acquisition costs.
💰 A ₹10,000 Cr+ market opportunity – And we have the right playbook to scale.
🔁 Recurring Revenue Model – Built for long-term, profitable growth.

This isn’t just another EdTech play—it’s a scalable, high-margin opportunity that others have overlooked.

I’d love to share why this works—can we schedule a quick 10-minute chat this week? Let me know a time that works for you.

Best regards,
Deepak Kumar
Co-founder, Edu Tantr
