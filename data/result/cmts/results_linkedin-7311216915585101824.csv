Chandra Prakash J.,https://www.linkedin.com/in/jatcpg,Marketplace Growth | Cross-Border Trade | Food @Walmart Canada | Ivey MBA,"Loved this post, Rishabh, really resonated with me.

When I started out, I was tempted to chase every channel too. But I chose to focus all my energy on just one platform on one time and committed to doing one product line at a time, even though I was managing multiple categories and brands behind the scenes.

That focus helped me go deep: understanding what drives real growth, building strong customer feedback loops, and figuring out what works operationally. Once I had that clarity, I gradually expanded into other marketplaces, Shopify, and international markets, but always with the mindset of staying lean and deliberate.

That strategy helped me consistently build strong category positions not by being everywhere, but by being intentional and ready to scale when the foundation was solid.

Appreciate you putting this out there, more D2C founders need to hear this.
