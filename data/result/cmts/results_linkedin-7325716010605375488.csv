Failing to have inventory at the right time & adding inventory at the wrong time, is a pain to the system financially. 

Here’s a real case:
There’s a much similar case last October 2024. One of our client failed to stock a product (just a particular colour) which affected almost 30% of sales, And they refilled it by end of November. 

Now it’s a winter wear. The stock added was almost at end of sale season. Usually winter sales for sweatshirts & hoodies continues to have its peak till December mid & slows down by Jan first half. 

What happened it the inventory got dumped still. Almost 5 months, 3.5 Cr worth finished products & 2 crore worth raw materials.",2025-05-07T03:18:03.245Z,"urn:li:comment:(activity:7325716010605375488,7325720545042280450)",,rishabh mariwala hope you find value with this comment failing to have inventory at the right time adding inventory at the wrong time is a pain to the system financially heres a real case theres a much similar case last october one of our client failed to stock a product just a particular colour which affected almost of sales and they refilled it by end of november now its a winter wear the stock added was almost at end of sale season usually winter sales for sweatshirts hoodies continues to have its peak till december mid slows down by jan first half what happened it the inventory got dumped still almost months cr worth finished products crore worth raw materials,0.133,0.801,0.066,-0.8666,Negative
