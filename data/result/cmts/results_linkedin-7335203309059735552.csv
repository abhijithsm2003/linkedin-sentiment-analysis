MANSI GOEL,https://www.linkedin.com/in/mansi-goel-926aa7209,Managing Director Fund Raising & Investor Relations,"Thanks for sharing, Rishabh. You’ve raised some interesting points, but I believe there's still a significant trust deficit when it comes to D2C brands—particularly around the gap between what they claim and what they actually deliver.

During my international travels, I’ve tried many of the types of products you mentioned—different brands, but often the same ingredients and nutritional values. And interestingly, I’ve never once questioned their authenticity. For instance, just two days ago in Slovenia, I picked up a coconut-based probiotic yoghurt from a local grocery store. It was delicious and left me feeling genuinely satiated.

But in India, the scenario feels very different. Adulteration and misleading claims are unfortunately common. The regulatory oversight, especially from bodies like FSSAI, seems weak or practically absent. This lack of enforcement creates an environment where entrepreneurs can prioritize profits over consumer well-being—sometimes at the cost of public health.

So the real question is: in a system with minimal checks and balances, who is accountable for ensuring that products sold to consumers are safe, authentic, and truly what they claim to be?",2025-06-03T19:23:20.764Z,"urn:li:comment:(ugcPost:7335203309059735552,7335747941095108609)",,thanks for sharing rishabh youve raised some interesting points but i believe theres still a significant trust deficit when it comes to dc brandsparticularly around the gap between what they claim and what they actually deliver during my international travels ive tried many of the types of products you mentioneddifferent brands but often the same ingredients and nutritional values and interestingly ive never once questioned their authenticity for instance just two days ago in slovenia i picked up a coconutbased probiotic yoghurt from a local grocery store it was delicious and left me feeling genuinely satiated but in india the scenario feels very different adulteration and misleading claims are unfortunately common the regulatory oversight especially from bodies like fssai seems weak or practically absent this lack of enforcement creates an environment where entrepreneurs can prioritize profits over consumer wellbeingsometimes at the cost of public health so the real question is in a system with minimal checks and balances who is accountable for ensuring that products sold to consumers are safe authentic and truly what they claim to be,0.081,0.697,0.222,0.9812,Positive
