 I’m Deepak, Co-founder of Edu Tantr.
 We believe the future of EdTech is not courses — it’s OTT. 
That’s why we built Eduk8 — India’s first OTT-style learning platform for college students.
What it is: ₹8/day subscription → unlimited access to certified, industry-relevant programs. 
🔁Why it works: Recurring revenue, zero CAC (college onboarding), habit-based learning like Netflix/Duolingo. 
📈Traction: 7K+ students, 6 signed MoUs, revenue-positive at pilot scale. 
🔓Retention moat: A “Pro Mode” unlocks internships, job tools, certifications — only if they maintain a 3-month streak. Break the streak? 
Would love to send the deck and share next steps.
