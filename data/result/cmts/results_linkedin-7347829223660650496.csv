While you can't hire someone to ""sell something the market does not want,"" you can hire someone who can help you figure out what the market does want and then build it.   

Also the hire might tell you the fact which founders seldom want to listen and thats  POOR MARKET FIT!!

The nuance is that senior talent isn't just a megaphone; they can be the compass and the mapmaker, especially when the initial direction is unclear or incorrect.
Ultimately, it comes down to how you use senior talent. If you hire them merely to ""amplify your direction"" when that direction is flawed, then yes, it's a wasted effort. 
But if you hire them to collaboratively find the right direction and then lead the charge, they can be an invaluable asset in solving a broken product's fundamental issues.
