1) Out of those dozen pitches a day , you might be binning all 

2) If a Founder of a startup or MSME knows how to visualise what you want them to do , they actually shall be on auto pilot , basically you are choosing only those pitches where the opportunity is on verge of scaling up .

3) Such Founders , I work with ,don't need investor to scale up organically , they need investors only for inorganic growth 

I do represent such clients who have answers to all you seek.

4) As a first priority , I look for Customers who are willing to invest into the business and also play customer role and use the products , services thru their own revenue models .

In a way , I do reverse due diligence, am searching for investors who have their feet into the business ground too .
Those who don't think of exit strategy only always .
A Good Founder doesn't need money alone , he actually needs valuable customers more .

Best scenario is to get Customer cum investors for my clients.
2nd priority is pure investors too .
They are equally welcome because we have all you expect .
The bottom up !
Founders who solve real problems are always Bottom Up .
