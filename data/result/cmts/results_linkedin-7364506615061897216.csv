In today's market if you aren't seen being a new brand. At very first go specially in consumable category consumer tries a product out after repeated visibility. They slowly trust over time and then they try out hoping it would be good. If they are not even seen, the first purchase will be extremely difficult, and repeat won't even come into picture. Ofcourse, Consistent product quality is a mandatory offering. 

So new brands should use advertising to some extent in lean and optimised way to build awareness which will lead to first round of purchase and product quality will then help them to retain and get repeat orders.
