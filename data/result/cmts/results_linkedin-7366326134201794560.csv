Sarthak Saproo,https://www.linkedin.com/in/sarthak-saproo-168a54231,IVPS | Ramjas' 26 | Bcom. hons,"A kurti should earn its place in the rotation - not live in the back of the wardrobe.

We’re Karma Clothing ,  a founder-led Delhi label building premium, pure-cotton kurtis with one practical obsession: they must work in real life.
We focus on the small, often-ignored details that change everyday behaviour: breathable fabric, honest fits, and real pockets placed where you’ll actually use them. Add small-batch runs (no overproduction), transparent workmanship, and fair pricing — and you get pieces people reach for again and again.

Why it matters:
• Comfort = repeat wear — pure cotton that breathes in Indian weather.
• Pockets that perform — tiny design choice, huge daily payoff (phone, keys, chai).
• Small-batch & local — better quality control, less waste, more exclusivity.
• Fair pricing — premium feel without premium shock.

People don’t buy another kurti from us because it’s trendy — they buy it because it becomes their go-to. If that sounds like the kind of product you believe in, follow Karma Clothing  or DM us for a sample, pop-up collab, or wholesale conversation.
