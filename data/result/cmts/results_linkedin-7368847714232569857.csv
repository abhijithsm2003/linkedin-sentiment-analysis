In my experience, products rarely fail because they lacked innovation. They struggle because they never built a sustainable way to reach and retain customers.

Distribution is where trust, consistency, and culture come together. In India, this could mean something as simple as a shopkeeper in a small town recommending your brand, or as deep as creating rituals that make your product part of everyday life.

 In today’s landscape, distribution is the real moat, especially in India where cultural nuances, regional trust networks, and tiered market behaviors shape adoption far more than product features alone.

A smart founder knows that product innovation can win attention, but distribution innovation sustains growth. Whether it’s embedding into local rituals, building hyperlocal trust with salesforces, or designing digital-first loyalty loops, distribution defines whether a brand scales or stalls.
