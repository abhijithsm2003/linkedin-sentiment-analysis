As a pre-revenue, early-stage founder from a smaller city, I’ve lived the challenges firsthand: being underestimated because I didn’t graduate from IIT, IIM, or any top university, despite solving real, daily pain points of rural India, SHGs, and small merchants.

I’ve faced financial frauds, systemic negligence, and multiple setbacks in the past — yet investors often overlook grassroots-driven conviction in favor of pedigree or metro networks. Meanwhile, platforms exploit middlemen, ignore transparency, and undervalue the very communities they serve.

At TimePe, our mission isn’t just a business opportunity — it’s personal. Every SHG interaction, every merchant onboarded, every product decision comes from lived understanding, not trend-chasing.

Conviction is the multiplier. And for founders like us who truly care about grassroots impact, it’s the only thing keeping us going through skepticism, delayed support, and broken systems.
