I’ve seen firsthand how easy it is to get swept up in the “category wave” - especially when investor interest peaks around certain buzzwords. But the truth always shows up in retention and real-world usage. One of the most insightful pivots I witnessed was a founder who moved away from the “D2C wellness” narrative and went deep into solving a specific issue around nutritional deficiencies in semi-urban women. It wasn’t flashy, but the traction was real - because it started with a person, not a pitch deck. Categories may get you initial attention, but it’s the clarity around who you’re solving for that builds something that lasts.
