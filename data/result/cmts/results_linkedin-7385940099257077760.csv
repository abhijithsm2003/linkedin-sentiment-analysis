Everyone glorifies product-market fit — but in India, it’s distribution-desperation fit that truly decides who survives.

A great product without reach is a secret.
A great channel without trust is a scam.
But when the two align — that’s when scale becomes destiny.

The truth is, the Indian consumer doesn’t live in your TAM slide; she lives behind 2,000 kilometres of fragmented supply chains and a retailer who’ll stock you only if your salesman shows up again tomorrow.

Distribution isn’t the last chapter of the story — it’s the ink the entire story is written in.
