Because India isn’t a market — it’s a mosaic.
 And every founder who forgets that ends up selling “global frameworks” to local realities that refuse to obey them.
What you’ve articulated, Rishabh, is the difference between strategy and sensitivity.
 Between scaling numbers and scaling nuance.
The truth is, India rewards curiosity more than capital.
 The entrepreneurs who listen — to language, to festivals, to climate, to community — are the ones who quietly build the moats money can’t buy.
Your question, “What have we done that makes our distribution harder to copy?” is pure gold. Because in India, defensibility isn’t built in data rooms — it’s built in relationships.
