Sourav Sinha,https://www.linkedin.com/in/sourav,Co-founder at Brainium. Helping companies build strong tech teams and grow faster. 26 years in sales.,"This is so true, and I’ve seen it from the other side. The real threat rarely shows up looking like a threat. It shows up as a small shift in customer behaviour that most teams shrug off. By the time the pattern becomes visible in the boardroom, someone scrappy has already built a version of the future that customers find more intuitive.

I learned this early in my sales career in Bangalore. The moment I stopped assuming that what worked yesterday would work tomorrow, my entire approach changed. That lesson applies even more in business today. Every company has an alternate version of itself waiting to be built, and it is better to build it internally than be forced to respond to it externally.
