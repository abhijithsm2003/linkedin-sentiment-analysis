tapas sethi,https://www.linkedin.com/in/tapas-sethi-0b6b75397,Founder at — NScliq | Building India’s most accessible healthcare platform | Simplifying medical access for every Indian 🇮🇳 Dm:- tapassethi005@gmail.com,"Hey sir 👋
Hope you’re doing well!

I’m Tapas, Founder & CEO of NScliq — building India’s first fully integrated healthcare system.

Even today, patients struggle for basic access: • 10 Cr+ people visit private clinics daily, but there’s no unified system
• Reports, tests, and appointments take days
• Rural healthcare still confusing & under-connected
• Emergency & surgery bookings are chaotic with zero transparency

NScliq connects clinics + doctors + diagnostics + pharmacy + ambulances + surgeries into one platform — making healthcare fast, transparent & accessible anywhere.

Why I’m building this:
In 2022 I had a knee injury and had to visit 20+ clinics, waited months for MRI & surgery. That experience showed me how broken the system really is — and became my mission.

Vision – Pan-India rollout with rural-first approach
– Digital medical identity for every citizen
– Revenue: appointments, diagnostics, pharmacy, hospital partnerships & insurance

Ask Looking for the right mentor & early-stage investor to build this at scale.
If you’re open, I’d love 10 minutes to share the roadmap 🙏

Thank you for your time, Tapas | Founder & CEO – NScliq 📧 tapassethi005@gmail.com

I’m Tapas, Founder & CEO of NScliq — building India’s first fully integrated healthcare system.

Right now healthcare in India is still painful & disconnected: • 10 Cr+ people visit private clinics & test centres daily with no unified system
• Reports, tests & appointments take days
• Rural healthcare is under-connected
• Emergency & surgery bookings are chaotic & unclear

NScliq connects clinics + doctor appointments + online doctor connect + diagnostics + pharmacy + ambulances + surgeries into one single platform, making healthcare fast, transparent & accessible PAN India.

Vision:
– PAN India rollout (Rural + Urban)
– Digital medical identity for every citizen
– Revenue via appointments, diagnostics, pharmacy & hospital partnerships

Ask:
Looking for the right mentor & early-stage investor to build at scale. Our Investor Deck is ready — would love to walk you through the roadmap.

Can we schedule a 10 min Google Meet? 🙏

Here is another: rising funding does not equate to rising value. If money flows but structural fundamentals like product-market fit, unit economics, and governance don’t, then what improves is not the economy’s health, but only its noise. So the real question must be: are we building robust ventures or merely inflating valuation bubbles? Until the first, all enthusiasm about growth remains rhetoric.”
