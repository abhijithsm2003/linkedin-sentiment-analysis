Funding is not progress. Time is.

India needs more long horizon capital that is comfortable with slow starts, tough cycles and uneven years. The companies that create durable value are backed by investors who stay the longest.

Patient capital delivers:
- Better founder decision making
- Stronger culture
- Compounding advantages
- Reduced pressure for artificial growth

If you are a founder, choose the investor who values the journey as much as the outcome.

Longevity is the real competitive edge.

Category creators do something powerful. They shift consumer behaviour rather than chase it. They build new expectations rather than optimise old ones. They are not fighting for percentage gains. They are imagining a world that works differently.

India is entering a phase where the biggest opportunities lie in categories that do not fully exist yet. Health, food, sustainability, supply chain, personal care, climate, financial wellbeing. Consumers are changing faster than the categories built to serve them.

If you are building today ask yourself a simple question.
Am I entering someone else’s race or creating a new one?

The companies that lead the next decade will be the ones that choose the second path.

The gap between companies that scale into category leaders and the broader pool of VC backed startups is widening.

Globally, data shows that unicorns command post money valuations anywhere from 3x to 10x higher than closely matched peers. This premium emerges as early as the seed stage and continues across every round in the lifecycle.

In India, the trend points in the same direction even if the numbers are less granular. We now have more than 100 unicorns with a combined valuation above US 360 billion. Their scale and momentum place them in a different league from the average startup raising venture capital.

Something else is shifting. The time it takes to reach unicorn status has doubled. In 2024, the average timeline stretched to about 11 years, compared to roughly 5.5 years just a year earlier. This tells us that the companies breaking through today are doing so with far more resilience, clarity and durability built into their model.

We also know the broader funding environment in India has tightened. Deal volumes and average round sizes dropped meaningfully in 2023, making outperformance even harder to achieve.

Put together, the message is clear. Becoming a VC backed company in India is no longer the differentiator. Becoming an outlier is.

The next decade in Indian venture will belong to the companies that choose to play at that level from day one.

That pull took me into entrepreneurship with no grand plan, no MBA, and nothing more than my mother’s soap recipe and the belief that I had to start somewhere. Those early years shaped everything I know about resilience, uncertainty and the quiet realities of building from scratch.

Along the way, I discovered investing and began to understand founders from both sides of the table. 

Their courage, their doubts, and their determination felt familiar because I had lived that journey myself.

That is why Ideabaaz matters to me. It gives founders a space to speak honestly and bring their ideas forward without theatrics.

Success often brings comfort. Comfort creates blind spots. That is usually when disruption enters quietly.

India has seen this play out up close. The taxi market had operated the same way for years. Fragmented, offline, resistant to change. Uber arrived with a simple idea and reshaped consumer behaviour across the country. The incumbents were larger and more established. Uber imagined a different future and moved before anyone else realised what was shifting.

The pattern is familiar. Disruption rarely begins with size. It begins with someone willing to question the assumptions everyone else accepts.

If there is a product, service or model that could challenge your business, someone is already exploring it. The smarter move is to build that version of your company from within before it comes from outside.

AI can help you analyse markets, pressure test assumptions and understand competitive dynamics with greater precision. It cannot replace the judgment needed to evaluate a founder’s resilience, clarity and ability to execute.

The answer is simpler than people think. Deep understanding.

If you know the full history of your space, you signal something rare. You show respect for the craft. You show that you have taken the time to study what worked, what failed and why the market looks the way it does today.

Every sector has a trail of earlier attempts. Some were ahead of their time. Some collapsed under the wrong model. Some were limited by technology that has only now matured. When a founder can explain these patterns with clarity, it immediately changes the conversation.

Investors pay attention to that level of awareness. It shows discipline. It shows judgment. It shows that you are building with intelligence rather than ego.
The fastest way to lose a room is to pretend history does not matter. Saying you are better than everyone who tried before you is not confidence. It signals a lack of curiosity.

The founders who study their space deeply always stand out. They build sharper products. They ask better questions. They understand timing. They respect the complexity of the market they want to change.

After a Vipassana meditation retreat, I returned with a clear mind and deeper awareness. Mornings felt calmer, conversations felt more intentional, and each day carried a quiet sense of balance. For a while, that feeling stayed.

Then the pace of work, travel, and decision-making took over. That calm began to fade into the background.

It taught me something important. Change is not a single moment. It is a daily practice. The spark begins the journey, but structure helps it last.

Here are five ideas that have helped me sustain it over time.

1. Let it shape who you are.
When a practice becomes part of your identity, it stays. Mindfulness stopped being something I did. It became a way of being in how I lead, think, and respond.

2. Design for it.
Habits thrive when the environment makes them easy. Small cues like starting the morning in silence, keeping time away from screens, or pausing between meetings make a big difference.

3. Build accountability.
Sharing goals and progress with people who value similar growth helps you stay consistent. Growth feels lighter when it is shared.

4. Accept the rhythm of life.
Disruptions are inevitable. The key is to return quickly without guilt or frustration. The return matters more than the slip.

5. Reflect often.
A few quiet minutes each week to notice what worked and what did not can reset your focus and direction.

Change that lasts is rarely dramatic. It grows through repetition, awareness, and small steady choices that align with who you want to become.

Companies grow through daily habits, weekly reflection, and the consistency that comes long before scale shows up on a chart.

Founders who sustain momentum often share a quiet quality. They stay centered when the situation shifts. They learn from customers with curiosity instead of defending their original idea. They treat feedback as fuel. Their clarity is steady, not loud.

There is always a moment in a conversation where the belief becomes visible. It may appear in how they describe the user, the problem, or the journey so far. It may be subtle, yet it carries conviction. That signal matters more than presentation polish or vocabulary.

Investor conversations can often sound like cocktail chatter, filled with opinions, predictions, and urgency. Market noise creates momentum, and momentum can easily be mistaken for insight.

Over time, I have learnt to pause and ask one question before every decision. What evidence have we earned, and what are we assuming. That single distinction separates clarity from consensus.

In early-stage investing, stories are easy to find. The real edge lies in process. Speak to customers, understand their patterns, and listen to what they value. Study the P and L until the numbers reveal where the business truly stands. Test the distribution logic until it works under pressure. Only then does conviction hold weight.

Founders who follow this approach build companies that endure. Investors who practise it make decisions they can trust through every market cycle.

Hype fades quickly. Discipline lasts longer and compounds quietly.

The Western playbook rarely fits India. Our markets move to a different rhythm. Retail is fragmented, cultures shift every few kilometres, and buying behaviour changes with seasons, festivals, and even weather patterns.

Founders who succeed here understand these nuances early. They adapt formats, pricing, and distribution to local realities. They design SKUs that fit quick commerce baskets. They build loyalty through cultural rituals that matter to their audience. They empower field teams whose relationships and reputation drive trust in smaller towns.

India rewards founders who respect complexity. When strategy aligns with cultural truth, customer acquisition costs fall, retention improves, and working capital begins to breathe.

Every quarter, I ask one question. 

What have we done that makes our distribution harder to copy. The answer to that shapes long-term advantage.

Awareness can be created through campaigns. Affinity must be earned through experience.

Every consumer brand starts with visibility, but the real journey begins after the first purchase. Repeat purchase is the true brand score. It reflects trust, habit, and emotional connection.

In a market like India, building affinity is about consistency in small details. The flavour that never disappoints. The packaging that feels familiar in a crowded shelf. The service that solves a problem quickly without friction. These are the quiet cues that make a brand part of a customer’s life.

When we evaluate consumer companies, we look for signals of this emotional durability. High retention rates, repeat purchases, and community-led growth all point to affinity. They show that the brand has moved from being a product to becoming a preference.

Great brands win twice. 

First in the market, then in the mind.

The show gives founders across India a platform to share their journeys in their own languages. It captures the raw energy of entrepreneurship that exists in every town, every city, and every dreamer who believes in building rather than waiting.

This is storytelling with purpose, stories that inspire, teach, and show us that innovation is not limited to metros or boardrooms. It lives wherever people have the courage to act on their ideas.

It can think across decades, observe patiently, and act with precision. The capital is patient, yet the intent is sharp. 
Flexibility allows it to explore funds for insights, co-invest when conviction is strong, and support founders through both growth and correction cycles.

For me, every investment begins with three questions:
 ✅ Is the founder’s drive visible in the way they build?
 ✅ Are the unit economics sound enough to sustain scale?
 ✅ Does the distribution network become stronger with time?

Access to diverse funds and partnerships brings intelligence, but decisions rest on one core principle. Do we truly understand the customer’s behaviour well enough to anticipate where demand will move. When that clarity exists, conviction follows naturally.

The advantage of a family office lies in its ability to combine patience with precision. It can move quickly when required, yet stay committed when markets fluctuate. That balance creates lasting value for founders, for partners, and for the ecosystem it believes in.

Every founder talks about product strength. Fewer talk about route to market with the same intensity. The winners do.

Here is the thing. Distribution is a day one question. Channels create truth. They reveal price points that convert, claim packaging that lands, and geographies where your story actually travels.

In India, defensibility often hides in the boring parts. Local networks that move inventory on time. A sales motion that Tier 2 retailers trust. Partnerships that lower unit economics as you scale. Nail this and the feedback loop compounds in your favour.

When I meet a consumer startup, I first ask how they plan to win shelf space in the mind and in the market. Product can create interest. Distribution builds advantage that lasts.

Last weekend at the ASCENT Conclave, in a conversation with Aditi Kothari Desai, we spoke about leadership and legacy. The idea that what you inherit can be both a foundation and a test.

It is easy to take comfort in what already exists. The safety of a family name. The familiarity of systems that work. Yet legacy means little if it does not evolve. Every generation has a choice; to preserve what was or to reimagine what could be.

Here is what I keep coming back to:
👉 The blueprint you inherit is only a starting point
 👉 True leadership is measured by what you add, not what you maintain
 👉 Conviction matters more than comparison
 👉 Playing safe may protect the past but it rarely builds the future

To anyone who has grown up around success, remember this. Legacy is not a shield. It is a challenge. The real privilege is having the chance to create your own story within it.

Here’s to those who build forward, not backward.

When I meet second-time founders in India, there is one consistent difference. They are ruthless about saying no.

First-time founders try to do it all. Launch in multiple cities at once. Chase every distribution partnership. Hire for functions they do not need yet.

Second-time founders cut faster. They know distraction is more dangerous than competition. One retail pilot at a time. One core SKU before the catalogue expands. They do not confuse activity with progress.

This discipline is not cynicism. It is clarity born from scar tissue.

They race to grab headlines, close the initial round, and claim they are defining a category.

The truth is, being first rarely matters. What matters is being right.
India has shown this again and again.

The first e-commerce companies were not the ones that won. The first food delivery apps were not the ones that survived. The first D2C brands in categories like beauty or personal care are not the ones leading today.

Why? Because the market does not reward pioneers. It rewards those who execute, who adapt, who understand the customer deeply and scale patiently.

The founder who listens to their customer will always beat the founder who rushes to be early.

If you are spending more time worrying about competitors than about whether your customer is coming back, you are fighting the wrong battle.

First mover advantage is a headline. Real advantage comes from retention, insight, and execution.

So the question is not “Can I be the first?”
It is “Can I be the one that lasts?”

In Indian consumer businesses, trust compounds faster than capital.

It is built quietly. Deliveries that reach smaller towns on time. Refunds that happen without a fight. Products that are consistent every single time.

We often celebrate blitzscaling. But the brands that become household names in India are the ones that customers feel safe to reorder from. Whether it is daily staples or premium experiences, trust drives repeat more than any campaign.

Trust does not show up on your P&L every quarter but it defines your P&L every decade.

Energy is contagious. Investors sense it in reviews. Employees absorb it daily. Customers feel it in your brand voice.

Every quarter, I meet founders who proudly say, “We are in the quick commerce space” or “We are building for D2C beauty.”

The label sounds good in a pitch room. But my first question is always the same. Who is your customer?

Because categories are investor constructs. Customers do not think in categories. They think in problems.

In India, I have seen founders chase “hot” tags like edtech or BNPL because capital was flowing, only to realise that retention and monetisation were weak once the initial hype wore off. 

At the same time, I have seen businesses solving everyday challenges like affordable protein or efficient distribution in Tier 2 towns not glamorous categories, but deeply needed. They scaled quietly, sustainably.

If your customer does not care about the category, then neither should you. Build for a person, not for a slide.

Founders love hearing customer praise. It feels good. It motivates. But from an investor’s seat, praise is noise.

The real signal is in behaviour. Does the customer come back without discounts? Do they refer others? Do they use your product daily or weekly, even without nudges?

In consumer, intent and action are often misaligned. People say they love a product. Then they stop using it two weeks later.

As a founder, train yourself to look past words. Study the data. Study repeat rates, retention curves, usage frequency.

The harshest truth in consumer is this: customers vote with their time and wallet, not their compliments.

But in reality, most categories are not created from scratch. They are reframed. They emerge from solving a real customer pain so well that people start seeing the problem differently.

Think about D2C in India. The strongest brands were not creating new needs. 

They were addressing existing ones in better, more relevant ways convenience, trust, design, distribution.

Category creation is not about press headlines. It is about changing behaviour. 

If your product is not altering habits, you are not building a new category. You are adding noise to an old one.

The mistake I see is when founders misalign their calendars. 

Seed-stage founders spending most of their week pitching investors instead of building. 

Series B founders still micromanaging features while culture slips through the cracks.

This mismatch between capital and capability is what breaks early-stage companies. The pressure pushes founders to make short-term decisions, cut corners, and burn trust with investors.

Here is the truth: there is nothing wrong with waiting. Waiting until your product has depth. Waiting until your early users stay without incentives. Waiting until your numbers tell a clear story.

It is the clock.

The pace at which capital runs out. The time it takes to prove your thesis. The gap between launch and sustainable unit economics.

I meet founders who have product momentum but burn rates that leave them with less than a year to figure out retention, distribution efficiency, and pricing discipline. The product may be strong, but the runway is too short to navigate the learning curve.

The most resilient founders build with time in mind. They set up supply chains that can scale without breaking margins. They design marketing to grow repeat purchase before expanding reach. They ensure every quarter extends the business’s ability to survive market shocks.

A longer runway is not just safety. It is leverage. It lets you test, adapt, and capture market share with intention instead of desperation.

Before you chase the next growth spike, ask yourself one question. Will this choice buy me more time to get it right?

In the consumer space, time well used is often the ultimate competitive edge.

It is a responsibility.

Too often, I see early-stage founders raise at valuations that feel good in the moment but set them up for trouble later.

You raise two million at a thirty million post. No revenue yet, but big plans. A year later, you hit three hundred thousand ARR. That is real progress. It is also not enough to justify a significant step-up.

Every round sets a benchmark. If your valuation outpaces your progress, future funding becomes harder, not easier. Investors begin to question the gap, and the pressure compounds at each stage.

At Sharrp, we see this pattern repeat. Founders focus on dilution, momentum, and optics. But very few pause to ask what numbers will justify my next round?

There is no magic in a high valuation unless you grow into it. Otherwise, you are spending more time trying to meet expectations than building your business.

The best founders do the opposite. They raise what they need. They price for where they are. They set targets they can hit within 18 to 24 months.

Ask yourself one thing before signing your next term sheet.
What will make the next round obvious?

If you do not have that answer, pause.

Building a company is hard. You need space to grow into your potential, not race against it.

Be realistic. Be intentional. That is how real value gets built.

What struck me was not just the pace of innovation, but the mindset everyone seemed to carry.

It was not loud. It was not performative. It was just real.

Here are five things that stood out to me...

1. Openness is the default. People share what they are building, what they are learning and where they are stuck. There is no fear of someone stealing ideas

2. There is an insane bias toward action. You will not find long debates or polished decks. People move fast, test quickly and adjust in real time

3. Builders get respect early. You do not need credentials or connections. If you are building something useful, you are already in the room

4. Thinking big is the norm. No one is trying to be incremental. Ambition is expected, not admired from a distance

5. The talent density is unmatched. Almost every conversation sharpens your thinking. The energy is contagious and makes you want to raise your game

Being in that kind of environment rewires how you approach your own work. It reminds you what is possible when people are focused, clear and generous with their thinking

Not all ecosystems are like this. But when you find one, pay attention. It will push you in the right way.

And the one slide that consistently misses the mark?

The TAM–SAM–SOM concentric circle masterpiece.

I skip past it every time.

Here’s why.

One, of course you’re going to say the market is massive. We all know India is a billion-plus population story. That’s not new.

Two, most founders map the market as it stands today. But the real opportunity is in where it is going, not where it’s been.

Three, the numbers are often stitched together from different sources and categories that don’t align with what you're actually building for.

And let’s be honest — a lot of it is cherry-picked, top-down theory with no connection to the real customer or execution on the ground.

I have made the same mistake.

Here’s what works better.

Go bottom up.

Start with what you’ve built. Who is using it. How often. What they are paying. What problem it solves.

Then walk us forward.

Who else this can reach. What categories it can stretch into. How habits and consumption are changing.

This gives us much more than a market estimate. It shows us how you think about GTM, retention, unit economics, brand, distribution, team, geography — all in one frame.

A grounded slide with real customer behaviour and forward momentum beats theoretical billions every time.

There is a visible shift in the early-stage funding environment in India. 

Valuations are more grounded.

This is not the end of opportunity. It is the return of discipline.

Founders who raised capital easily in the past are now being asked harder questions. Investors are not pulling away. They are simply moving slower, with more intent.

This is where resilience shows. Founders who have focused on clarity, frugality, and customer stickiness are still raising. The ones who relied only on pitch decks are facing silence.

This slowdown is not closing doors. It is revealing which teams are truly prepared to build through cycles.

The capital is still there. The scrutiny is just higher and that is a good thing for everyone who is building with purpose.

Month after month, I see the shift in capital and attention back to Bharat.

In Q1 2025, consumer startups focused on Bharat themes vernacular, convenience, Tier‑2/3 networks accounted for nearly 40 percent of all deals.

Regional language apps are seeing engagement rise over 50 percent year-on-year. 

That is the power of solving for context - shopkeeper routines, local festivities, even how tea arrives at homes in the heartland.

This is not superficial localisation. It is culture-led product design.

Winning in Bharat means leaning in on:
• Language flows - creating UI, help, even onboarding in local dialects.
• Distribution realities - consistency meets motorcycle routes and store trust.
• Social norms - kitchen culture, familial buying patterns, community rituals.

Startup founders are often encouraged to think global fast. Great, but only after you’ve thought Bharat deep.

Companies that capture these layers aren’t chasing scale. They are defining scale. The rest become catering slides for VC decks.

That is the discomfort this video of Nuseir Yassin stirred up.

It holds up a mirror to the way we justify what we are used to. Whether it is tradition or taste, we rarely pause to question the system behind it.

This is the same discomfort that made me reflect on my own food choices.

Veganism was never about being perfect. It began with a simple thought of what am I supporting when I choose convenience over compassion.

We all evolve at our own pace. That is okay.

The important thing is to keep asking the harder questions. Especially the ones we are used to avoiding.

The Startup Ignite pitch stage was a highlight. Seven impressive startups presented their ideas to a jury of aligned investors. I had the opportunity to be part of that jury along with Siddharth Kothari, Hiren Kara, Ruchika Jain Ⓥ, Punit Mehta, Mudit Jain, Karan Mehta and Yash Biyani.

Congratulations to the two startups recognised for their pitch quality and clarity of thought. ProMeat and Hemptyful stood out for their conviction and clarity. Each of the other finalists — Oatey, nattier!, CURRY N PEPPER LLC, Tempeh Di Mumbai and The Green Meat brought something original to the table and left a mark.

The energy in the room made one thing clear. India’s plant-based innovation ecosystem is growing not just in size but in maturity. The ideas are sharper. The intent is deeper. The talent is real.

Grateful to Palak Mehta and the organisers for creating a space where ideas, capital and purpose can meet meaningfully.

Every month, we review consumer brands that are innovating across categories, not just in terms of ingredients but also in how they think about format, flavour, and function.

Here are 10 international brands that stood out recently. Each one holds a mirror to where Indian brands could go next:

1. Bask Suncare
Non-aerosol mineral sunscreen spray. Reapplication made simple.
👉 India is still warming up to SPF sprays. But formats like this are exactly what will grow the category.

2. Cocojune Products
Coconut-based probiotic yoghurts. Clean, creamy, plant-forward.
👉 Alt-dairy in India has potential if we stop chasing soy and start thinking taste-first.

3. Drumroll Snacks
High-protein, low-sugar donuts. Indulgence meets macros.
👉 Snacking in India still leans clinical or cheat-day. This sits right in the middle.

4. Ella's Flats
Seed crackers used as snack bases. Crisp, whole, visually vibrant.
👉 This is a packaging and positioning story waiting to happen in India’s urban centres.

5. Hero Bread
0–1 net carb bread with protein and fibre. Strong influencer play.
👉 Indian health bread players can unlock bigger value through branding, not just claims.

6. NUFYX® 
Keto plant protein powders that feel like dessert. Organic, digestible, smooth.
👉 Plant protein here is gaining traction, but taste is still an afterthought.

7. SAUZ
Fresh pasta sauces with bold ingredients. Focused on flavour, not fear.
👉 Clean label in India is often too cautious. There is room for brands to lead with confidence.

8. STRANGE WATER
Sparkling coconut water. Same base, new behaviour.
👉 This is one of the smartest repositioning moves I have seen. India’s coconut water brands can push this.

9. Visitor Beer*
Crisp non-alcoholic beer with branding that works at bars.
👉 We are seeing early signs here, but there is a long way to go in taste and occasion mapping.

10. Whims Delights
Oat milk chocolate bites. Vegan, low-sugar, genuinely snackable.
👉 No one is owning this space in India yet. Huge opportunity.

Each of these brands tells us something: the edge is no longer about ingredients. It is about how clearly you solve a real-world moment with joy, function, and relevance.

To Indian founders building in food, wellness, or skincare, there is white space waiting to be owned.

In the pursuit of convenience, many consumer brands overlook the hidden costs. Quick fixes and shortcuts might boost short-term metrics but can erode long-term brand equity.

Consider:
- Are your supply chains sustainable?
- Is your product quality consistent?
- Does your customer service reflect your brand values?

Convenience should not compromise integrity.

They were not loud lessons. They came slowly, through experience, through stillness, and through choosing to pay attention.

1. Health is the foundation. Everything else is built on it. Without it, even the best plans fall apart. Prioritise it before you are forced to.

2. Time is your most valuable asset. If you give it away too freely, it disappears without return. Invest it with intention. Let it grow into something meaningful.

3. Friendships are among life’s most enduring gifts. The ones that stay without expectation, without performance, are rare. Nurture them with care.

4. Forgiveness is not about forgetting. It is about releasing the weight you were never meant to carry. Forgive early so you can move freely.

5. There is wisdom in walking away. Not every path deserves your presence. Knowing when to step back is strength, not failure.

Still learning. Still walking. Still open to where the road leads next.
Grateful for all the steps it has taken to reach here.

Mass appeal is being replaced by meaningful relevance.

""In what ways does the world pull at you in an attempt to make you normal? 

How much work does it take to maintain your distinctiveness? 

To keep alive the things that make you special? 

We all know that distinctiveness and originality is valuable. We are all taught to ""be yourself."" 

What I'm really asking you to do is to embrace and be realistic about how much energy it takes to maintain that distinctiveness. 

The world wants you to be typical, in a thousand ways it pulls at you. Don't let it happen. 

You have to pay a price for your distinctiveness, and it's worth it. 

The fairy tale version of ""be yourself"" is that all the pain stops as soon as you allow your distinctiveness to shine. That version is misleading. Being yourself is worth it, but don't expect it to be easy or free. 

You'll have to put energy into it continuously.

In the consumer space, early traction can feel like a green signal to go faster. More SKUs. More channels. More markets.

What gets overlooked is whether the backend is ready to handle it.

We once met a founder who had doubled revenue in one year, but their working capital cycle had stretched to a point where they were chasing growth with no cash in the bank.

In the rush to win market share, they were losing control.

At Sharrp Ventures, we do not get excited by speed. We get excited by repeatability.

Are your customers coming back?
Is your team able to deliver consistently?
Do your margins hold when discounts are removed?

These are the questions that build enduring brands.

If you are building a consumer startup today, ask yourself this:
Can your operations handle the scale you are chasing?

The brands that last are the ones that scale their backend as deliberately as they grow their front end.

Growth is visible. Resilience is invisible.
The best founders build both.

Others begin with a conversation that stays with you.

When I met Rachna a few months ago, we ended up speaking at length about the world of celebrity endorsements. It is a space that looks glamorous from the outside, but behind the scenes are grey areas, fragmented processes, and high-stakes decisions.

Through her work at Thriverse, Rachna has been helping brands bring more structure, clarity and long-term thinking to this space. That conversation sparked an idea - what if we built something together that made this landscape easier to navigate?

Over the past few weeks, Thriverse Advisory and Sharrp Ventures | Harsh Mariwala Investment Office came together to create a tactical playbook on celebrity endorsements designed for founders, marketers, and brand leaders who are working through these decisions in real time.

What is often missing is the discipline to pause.

To check if your internal systems can support what your ambitions are chasing.
To ensure your team is ready, your margins are stable, your supply chain is flexible enough to absorb scale without breaking.
To ask whether your product experience is consistent across the shelves that already exist.

Growth looks exciting externally. Alignment feels steady internally.

The most resilient brands are not the ones that grow the fastest. They are the ones that know when to hold before they push.

Growth is a privilege. So is patience.

It gave me a window into a culture shaped by quiet strength, shared values, and deep-rooted discipline.

Here are a few things that stood out:

1. Respect is central. From how people greet each other to how they conduct conversations, there is a strong sense of mutual respect woven into daily life.

2. Attention to detail is a way of being. Whether it is the way food is plated or how a train platform is marked, everything is done with care and precision.

3. Time is honoured. Punctuality is non-negotiable. Being on time is seen as a sign of respect for others and for your own word.

4. Cleanliness is collective. Public spaces are spotless, not because of rules, but because people take personal ownership of shared environments.

5. Harmony guides behaviour. The focus is on community over individualism. Decisions are made with consideration for how they affect the whole.

There is a quiet power in this kind of culture. One that makes you pause, observe, and re-evaluate how we live and work. 

Coming back, I find myself asking - how can we bring some of this clarity, respect, and intentionality into the way we build, lead, and grow?

There is a lot of pressure on founders to launch fast, raise fast, scale fast.

But consumer behaviour rarely changes overnight. Real adoption takes time.

I have seen startups launch seasonal products in non-seasonal cycles, chase trends without demand, and invest heavily in marketing without first fixing distribution.

Being fast is useful. But being in sync with market timing is powerful.

Patience with insight often outlasts urgency with assumptions.

Consumer brands in India do not scale overnight. The companies that succeed are the ones that understand patience is part of the process.

Most founders overestimate how fast they can grow and underestimate how long it takes to build trust. Unlike tech startups that can scale through code, consumer brands need distribution, word-of-mouth, and a strong reputation.
Indian consumers have options. They will not commit to a brand unless they see long-term value. 

This means repeatable quality, customer experience, and consistent brand messaging over years, not just viral campaigns and deep discounting.

If you are building a brand, think about how it will sustain for decades, not just the next quarter.

The real competition is not other startups. It is time.

Indian startups have spent the last few years chasing growth at all costs. Now, funding is harder to come by and everyone is talking about a funding winter.
The truth is, this is not a downturn. It is a reset.

Investors are no longer excited by high burn rates and flashy expansion plans. They want to see businesses that are disciplined, efficient, and built for sustainability. A startup that can survive without constant external capital is always in a stronger position.

Valuations are a reflection of fundamentals. When the focus shifts back to profitability, capital efficiency, and customer stickiness, the companies that have been built well will thrive.

- Does my pricing align with my brand positioning? Premium brands cannot be priced for mass, and vice versa.

Some ideas stand out because they solve a real problem in a way that feels natural. MetaShot is one of them.

When Prince Thomas, Ranjit Behera, and Ajith Sunny started working on MetaShot, they were not looking at cricket as just a game. They saw an opportunity to bring the experience of playing into homes, making it more accessible and engaging. Their passion for the sport and deep understanding of the Indian market shaped a product that fits seamlessly into everyday life.

This vision came to life on Shark Tank India, where MetaShot not only secured an investment but received twice the amount they asked for. The response was incredible, with multiple offers and strong appreciation from all the sharks.

As investors, we look for founders who are committed to building with purpose. The MetaShot team left high-paying careers to pursue their love for cricket and build something that resonates with millions. Their approach—blending technology with sport to create shared experiences—is what makes this investment exciting.

MetaShot is Made in India, for the world. It is built for a market where cricket is deeply loved and where affordability matters. The product is strong, the team is relentless, and the opportunity ahead is huge.

Excited to be a part of this journey.

2. Using tech to optimise routes and reduce costs in hard-to-reach areas.
3. Offering flexibility in delivery options, such as lockers and community hubs.

Startups that innovate around last-mile logistics will not just improve customer satisfaction—they will redefine the standard for convenience in India.
